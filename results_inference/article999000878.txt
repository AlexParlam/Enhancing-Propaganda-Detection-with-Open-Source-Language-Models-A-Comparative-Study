After analyzing the article, I detected some propaganda techniques:

1. **Labeling** (Technique 10): The article labels Jim Acosta and CNN as victims of the Trump administration's "vicious attacks" and "threats," which may appeal to the audience's emotions.
2. **Repetition** (Technique 11): The article repeats phrases like "tussle with a White House intern over a microphone" and "Acosta refused to hand the mic over" multiple times, emphasizing the point that Acosta was being confrontational.
3. **Black-and-White Fallacy** (Technique 4): The article presents two alternative options: either Acosta's press pass should have been revoked or he should have been escorted from the room. This oversimplifies the issue and implies that there are only two possible solutions.
4. **Reductio ad Hitlerum** (Technique 3): The article mentions President George Bush being involved in a confrontation with Sam Donaldson, implying that Trump's behavior is similar to Bush's and therefore unacceptable.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in the article.
