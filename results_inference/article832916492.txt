After analyzing the article, I detected one propaganda technique:

* Loaded Language: The phrase "huge victory" is used multiple times to describe President Trump's outcome in a way that evokes strong positive emotions. This technique aims to sway the audience's opinion by using words with emotional impact.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
