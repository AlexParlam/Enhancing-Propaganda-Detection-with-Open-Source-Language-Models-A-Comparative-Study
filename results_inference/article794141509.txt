This article discusses the potential consequences of a "alternative media purge" on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. The author argues that this purge could have devastating effects on free speech, dissenting voices, and the ability to find alternative information.

The article highlights several points:

1. **Financial burden**: Running a website requires significant financial resources, making it difficult for alternative media outlets to survive without social media platforms.
2. **Google's role**: A leaked Google document suggests that the company may be actively censoring content, which could have far-reaching implications for free speech.
3. **Power of influence**: With 2 trillion daily searches and billions of users on Facebook and Twitter, these platforms wield significant power to shape public opinion.
4. **Brainwashing**: The author argues that social media can be used to brainwash people, especially when there is no alternative information presented.

To address the alternative media purge, the article suggests:

1. **Subscribe to newsletters**: Support your favorite websites by subscribing to their newsletters.
2. **Financial support**: Donate or support these sites financially through Patreon or other means.
3. **Bookmark and visit regularly**: Regularly visiting and engaging with alternative media outlets can help them stay afloat.
4. **Share content**: Share articles on your own social media accounts to amplify the voices of alternative media outlets.
5. **Join alternative platforms**: Explore alternative social media platforms like Gab and MeWe, which may be more open to diverse perspectives.

Overall, the article warns that the alternative media purge is just the beginning of a broader campaign against freedom of speech and thought.
