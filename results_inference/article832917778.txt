After analyzing the article, I did not detect any of the 14 propaganda techniques mentioned earlier. The language used in the article appears to be straightforward and factual, simply reporting on the submission of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's final report and the completion of his investigation. There are no apparent attempts to manipulate public opinion or use persuasive tactics to influence readers' beliefs or emotions. Therefore, my answer is:

No propaganda detected.
