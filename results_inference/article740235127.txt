I analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques listed earlier. Here are my findings:

* Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring: The author uses this technique when they say "Both nominations may face tough confirmation hearings, but it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices." This is an attempt to discredit Senator Rand Paul's opposition to the nominations by implying that most Americans support them.
* Name Calling/Labeling: The author does not explicitly use name-calling or labeling, but they do imply that people who support the nominations are acting out of emotion and fear.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques in this article. Therefore, my answer is:

No propaganda detected.
