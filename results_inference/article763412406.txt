I detected some propaganda techniques in this article:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of phrases like "widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls by organized gangs" and "Islamisation" to create a negative emotional impact on the reader.
2. **Flag-Waving**: Playing on strong national feelings (in this case, British patriotism) to justify or promote an action or idea, such as calling for a return to the God of their forefathers.

Additionally, some of the statements made by the speakers at the rally may be considered examples of:

1. **Rhetorical Questions**: The use of questions like "Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson..." is intended to elicit an emotional response from the reader rather than seeking genuine answers.
2. **Appeal to Fear**: Creating a sense of fear or threat, such as the idea that the UK is being complicit in the crimes of devout Muslims.

It's worth noting that some readers may interpret these techniques as biased or inflammatory, and others may see them as justified responses to perceived injustices.
