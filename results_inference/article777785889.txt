After analyzing the article, I found that several propaganda techniques were used:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The article creates fear by mentioning "armed 'Muslim extremists'" and the poor living conditions of the children.
2. **Exaggeration, Minimization**: The description of the compound as a "filthy" place with no water, plumbing, or electricity might be an exaggeration or minimization to emphasize the severity of the situation.
3. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The use of terms like "extremist" and "filthy" creates negative labels for the individuals involved.

I did not find any other propaganda techniques used in this article.
