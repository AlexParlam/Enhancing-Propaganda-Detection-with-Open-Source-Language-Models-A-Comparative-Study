I've analyzed the article and detected some propaganda techniques:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of strong emotional impact phrases such as "controlled opposition", "ruthless corporation", "lies", "doctored video", and "immature children" to sway the audience's emotions.
2. **Reductio ad Hitlerum**: The comparison of CNN to a "Clown News Network" is an example of this technique, trying to discredit CNN by associating it with something considered undesirable (in this case, clowns).
3. **Whataboutism/Straw Men**: The article questions Fox's decision to support CNN, implying that they are somehow equally wrong or misguided.
4. **Flag-Waving**: The use of patriotic language and the reference to "freedom" and the "American people" is an attempt to evoke strong national feelings.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
