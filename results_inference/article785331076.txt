After analyzing the article, I found several instances of propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The use of "blue privilege" to describe the officer's treatment is an example of name calling.
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases such as "sheer insane state", "super scary", and "slap in the face" are used to evoke strong emotions in the reader.
3. **Exaggeration, Minimization**: The statement "this is the first time we've reported a story of an off-duty cop going into the wrong home, on their way home, and killing someone" might be exaggerated or minimizing other similar incidents that have occurred.

However, I did not find any instances of Repetition, Flag-Waving, Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring, Doubt, or Minimization/Exaggeration as defined in the provided context. Therefore, my answer is:

No propaganda detected.
