After analyzing the article, I detected the use of the following propaganda techniques:

* 10 Name Calling/Labeling: The article labels Attorney General Barr's actions as "covering up" and Trump's administration as "obstructing this criminal investigation", which are emotionally charged labels intended to sway public opinion.
* 9 Loaded Language: Phrases such as "cover up", "criminal investigation", and "obstructing justice" carry strong emotional impact and are designed to create a negative perception of Barr and the Trump administration.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
