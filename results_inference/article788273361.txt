Based on the article, I detected several propaganda techniques used:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of phrases like "don't believe her story" and "smeared, threatened, isolated" creates a negative emotional impact on the reader.
2. **Flag-Waving**: By evoking strong emotions and creating a sense of patriotism ("Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?"), the article tries to justify or promote its point.
3. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: The article attempts to discredit the Democratic Party's response to Karen Monahan's allegations by comparing it unfavorably to their treatment of Christine Blasey Ford (Kavanaugh accuser).
4. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article labels the Democratic Party as not believing women's stories and accuses them of being hypocritical.

These propaganda techniques are used to sway public opinion, create an emotional response, and discredit opposing views.
