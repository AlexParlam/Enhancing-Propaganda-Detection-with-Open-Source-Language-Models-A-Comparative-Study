This text appears to be an excerpt from a book or article by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan. The passage describes how the military/security complex and other powerful interests in Washington D.C. have worked together to discredit and undermine the elected President of the United States, Donald Trump.

Roberts argues that Trump's efforts to normalize relations with Russia and reduce tensions between the two countries are being actively blocked by these powerful interests, which are seeking to maintain their influence and power over U.S. foreign policy. He claims that the Russiagate hoax is a key part of this effort, designed to discredit Trump and prevent him from achieving his goals.

Roberts also expresses skepticism about the ability of President Trump to effectively challenge the status quo in Washington D.C., noting that he lacks the power to fire and arrest officials who are working against him, or to indict prominent political figures like Hillary Clinton. He suggests that Trump is almost powerless to resist the efforts of these powerful interests, and that the outcome of this struggle is far from certain.

Overall, the passage presents a bleak view of the situation in Washington D.C., suggesting that powerful forces are actively working to undermine democratic governance and maintain their own influence over U.S. foreign policy.
