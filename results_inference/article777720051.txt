After analyzing the article, I detected a few propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article labels Siraj Wahhaj and Lucas Morten as "extremists of the Muslim belief" without providing direct evidence or context, which may be perceived as unfairly targeting Muslims.
2. **Repetition**: The article repeats the idea that the children were living in "deplorable conditions" and "starving" to emphasize the severity of the situation.

No other propaganda techniques mentioned (e.g., Black-and-White Fallacy, Causal Oversimplification, Doubt, Exaggeration, Minimization) appear to be used in this article.
