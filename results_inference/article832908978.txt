After analyzing the article, I found that it employs the following propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The phrase "WITCH HUNT" is used to label the Mueller investigation, implying that it's a baseless or unjustified probe.
2. **Loaded Language**: Terms like "witch hunt," "ridiculous," and "legit" are used to create emotional impact and sway readers' opinions.
3. **Exaggeration/Minimization**: The article implies that the Mueller report is just one aspect of Trump's legal woes, downplaying its significance.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
