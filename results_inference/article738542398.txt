After analyzing the article, I detected some propaganda techniques used:

1. **Flag-Waving**: The article mentions Gina Haspel's involvement in the CIA's "worst abuses" and her role in torturing detainees, which is meant to evoke strong emotions and create a sense of patriotism/national security.

No other techniques were detected in this specific article.
