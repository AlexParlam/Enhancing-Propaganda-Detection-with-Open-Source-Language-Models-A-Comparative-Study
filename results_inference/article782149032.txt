After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The article builds support for its idea by instilling anxiety and panic in the audience towards the Islamic compound and the people involved, portraying them as a threat.
2. **Reductio ad Hitlerum** (a subset of **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**): The phrase "sharia compliance in New Mexico" is an attempt to discredit Islam by implying that it is somehow incompatible with American values or laws.
3. **Bandwagon, Reductio ad Hitlerum**: The article's tone and language are designed to get the audience on board with its negative portrayal of the Islamic compound and its inhabitants.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
