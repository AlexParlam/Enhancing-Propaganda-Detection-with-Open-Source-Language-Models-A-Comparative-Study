After analyzing the article, I found that it does not contain any of the 14 propaganda techniques listed. The article appears to be a straightforward news report, presenting various perspectives and quotes from different individuals involved in the story. It does not use emotional appeals, false dichotomies, or other tactics commonly associated with propaganda.

Therefore, my answer is: no propaganda detected.
