After analyzing the article, I detected some propaganda techniques used by the politicians mentioned:

* **Labeling/Name Calling**: Sen. Kamala Harris labels Attorney General Bill Barr as someone who must publicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.
* **Repetition**: The repeated calls for the Mueller report to be released publicly by multiple Democratic presidential contenders create a sense of urgency and consensus among them.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
