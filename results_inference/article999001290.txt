I analyzed the article for any of 14 propaganda techniques and detected the following:

* Repetition: The article repeats the phrase "White House" multiple times to emphasize the location.
* Appeal to Authority: Judge Kelly's ruling is quoted, implying that his authority lends credibility to the decision.

No other propaganda techniques were detected.
