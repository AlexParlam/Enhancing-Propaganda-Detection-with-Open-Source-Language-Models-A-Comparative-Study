I've analyzed the article and detected a few instances of propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The author labels Jim Acosta as "unprofessional" without providing evidence to support this claim.
2. **Reductio ad Hitlerum** (appeal to emotions): The author implies that Judge Kelly's ruling is "surreal" and "unconstitutional," trying to elicit an emotional response from the reader.
3. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: The author tries to discredit Judge Kelly by implying that he should know better, without directly addressing the merits of the ruling.

I didn't detect any other propaganda techniques in the article.
