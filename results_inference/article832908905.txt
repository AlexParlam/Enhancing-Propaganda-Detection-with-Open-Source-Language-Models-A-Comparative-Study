After analyzing the article, I detected the following propaganda techniques:

1. Appeal to Authority (Appeal to Authority): The article quotes Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz cautioning that the report is a "prosecutorial document presenting only one side" and urging the public to withhold final judgment until they hear the other side of the story.

Additionally, I detected some subtle uses of propaganda techniques:

* Repetition: The article repeats Trump's claims about the Mueller investigation being a "witch hunt" without directly addressing or refuting them.
* Whataboutism (attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy): Representative Mark Meadows' tweet implies that the lack of collusion-related indictments means there was no collusion, which can be seen as a form of whataboutism.

No further propaganda techniques were detected.
