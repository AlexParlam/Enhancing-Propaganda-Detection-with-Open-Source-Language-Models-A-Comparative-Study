After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Bandwagon**: The article presents a sense of urgency and consensus among experts (World Health Organization and World Economic Forum) that a global pandemic is imminent, implying that you shouldn't be left out if you don't agree.
2. **Repetition**: The article repeats the message of an impending global pandemic multiple times to emphasize its importance and create a sense of fear.
3. **Name Calling/Labeling**: Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, labels the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) as having a "sinister" agenda, which might evoke a negative emotional response from readers.
4. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: The article presents Mike Adams' warning about a potential agenda behind the global pandemic warnings without directly addressing his concerns or providing evidence to support the W.H.O.'s intentions.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
