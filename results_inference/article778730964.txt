After analyzing the article, I detected some propaganda techniques used by Imam Siraj Wahhaj and his representative Ali Abdul-Karim Judan. Specifically:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: "AP would carry this story at all; certainly, neither AP nor the rest of the establishment media is ever so solicitous of those whom they smear as 'anti-Muslim'" - This statement gives a negative label to the AP and the establishment media.
2. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: "They hate Islam" - This statement builds support for Imam Wahhaj's position by instilling anxiety and panic in the audience towards an alternative (in this case, those who might be critical of his actions).
3. **Reductio ad Hitlerum** (Bandwagon): "War is deceit" - This phrase implies that critics are using unfair tactics, comparing them to those who use propaganda.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
