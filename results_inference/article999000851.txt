After analyzing the article, I detected some propaganda techniques:

1. **Labeling**: The article describes Jim Acosta's actions as "misbehavior" and CNN's lawsuit as an attempt to infringe on Trump's rights, framing them negatively.
2. **Repetition**: The article repeats the phrase "new rules of conduct" several times to emphasize their importance and create a sense of urgency.
3. **Black-and-White Fallacy**: The article presents two options: Acosta gets his pass back or he doesn't, implying that there's no middle ground or alternative solutions.

Please note that I did not detect any other propaganda techniques mentioned in the provided list (10 Name Calling/Labeling, 11 Repetition, 14 Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring, etc.).
