After analyzing the article, I did not detect any of the 14 propaganda techniques mentioned earlier (10 Name Calling/Labeling to 14 Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring). The article appears to be a factual report on a tragic event, providing details and quotes from police officials and 911 recordings. There is no attempt to sway public opinion or use manipulative language to achieve a particular goal. Therefore, my answer is:

No propaganda detected.
