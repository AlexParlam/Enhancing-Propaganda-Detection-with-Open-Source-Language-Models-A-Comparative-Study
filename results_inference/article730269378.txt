After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The author creates an emotional response by highlighting the suspect's race and criminal history, which may instill fear or anxiety in the audience.
2. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The author labels Quentin Lamar Smith as a "convicted felon" and implies that he is not allowed to have a gun due to his past.
3. **Black-and-White Fallacy**: By presenting two alternative options (Smith's race) without considering other possibilities, the author creates a false dichotomy.
4. **Repetition**: The author repeats the fact that Quentin Lamar Smith is a convicted felon and has a criminal history, emphasizing these points to create a negative impression.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
