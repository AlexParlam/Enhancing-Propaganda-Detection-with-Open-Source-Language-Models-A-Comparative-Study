I've analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques mentioned earlier. Here are some findings:

1. **Labeling** (technique 10): The article labels President Trump as a "treasonous enemy of America" and the military/security complex as a "threat to American democracy."
2. **Repetition** (technique 11): The article repeats phrases such as "the military/security complex," "President Trump is accused of treason for trying to make peace," and "the military/industrial complex was a threat to American democracy" to create a sense of familiarity and emphasis.
3. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring** (technique 14): The article attempts to discredit President Trump's efforts by claiming that he has been set up as a traitor and that the military/security complex is orchestrating a coup against him.
4. **Doubt** (technique 6): The article questions the credibility of President Trump, implying that his actions are suspect and motivated by selfish interests.
5. **Exaggeration, Minimization** (technique 7): The article exaggerates the dangers of nuclear war and minimizes the importance of normalizing relations with Russia.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
