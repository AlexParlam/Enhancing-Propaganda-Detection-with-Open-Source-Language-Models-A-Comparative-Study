I detected several propaganda techniques used in this article:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of phrases like "The Mueller circus", "grim face of Robert Mueller", and "Roman circus" evokes strong emotional responses, creating a sense of drama and spectacle.
2. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article labels the media as being driven by profit and the Democrats' investigations as "coup members", which is an inflammatory and pejorative term.
3. **Flag-Waving**: The article appeals to patriotic sentiment by framing President Trump's investigations and reforms as a defense against the "swamp" and its "malice and spite".
4. **Reductio ad Hitlerum**: The comparison of the Democratic-led investigations to a "Roman circus" is an over-the-top exaggeration, similar to the tactics used in the "Hitler" fallacy.
5. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: The article implies that the investigations are motivated by malice and spite, rather than presenting any concrete evidence or addressing the underlying issues.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
