After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The author labels Stacey Abrams as a "sore loser" and compares her to other politicians (Hillary Clinton) who have also been called out for not conceding.
2. **Red Herring**: The author raises questions about invalid provisional ballots, electronic voter manipulation, and non-citizen voters, but these are not directly related to the issue at hand (Abrams' decision not to concede). This distracts from the actual topic and tries to muddy the waters.
3. **Straw Man**: The author implies that Abrams is only seeking a concession because she lost, without addressing her concerns about "gross mismanagement" of elections.

These techniques are used to discredit Stacey Abrams, downplay her concerns, and portray her as an unfair player in the political game.
