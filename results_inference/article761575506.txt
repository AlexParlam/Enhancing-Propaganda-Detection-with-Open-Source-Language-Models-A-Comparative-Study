I analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques listed earlier. Here's what I found:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: None detected.
2. **Repetition**: None detected.
3. **Bandwagon, Reductio ad Hitlerum**: None detected.
4. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: None detected.
5. **Doubt**: None detected.
6. **Exaggeration, Minimization**: None detected.

Since I didn't find any of the propaganda techniques listed earlier in the article, my answer is:

No propaganda detected.
