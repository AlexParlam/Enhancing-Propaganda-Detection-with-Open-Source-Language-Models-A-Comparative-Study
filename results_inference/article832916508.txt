I've analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques. Here are my findings:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The article mentions "serious questions" about a potential cover-up, which might be seen as an attempt to build support by instilling anxiety in the audience.

That's it! No other propaganda techniques were detected.
