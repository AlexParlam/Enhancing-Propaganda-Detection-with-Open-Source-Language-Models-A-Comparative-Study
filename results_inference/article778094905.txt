After analyzing the article, I detected the following propaganda techniques:

* Appeal to Fear/Prejudice: The article builds support for its idea by instilling anxiety and panic in the audience towards Islamic extremism, implying that it's a threat to American safety.
* Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options as the only possibilities: either Islamic extremism is a real threat or political correctness is the problem. It ignores the possibility of more nuanced approaches.
* Causal Oversimplification: The article assumes that Barack Obama's presidency was directly responsible for Islamic extremist camps existing in America, without providing evidence to support this claim.

No other propaganda techniques were detected.
