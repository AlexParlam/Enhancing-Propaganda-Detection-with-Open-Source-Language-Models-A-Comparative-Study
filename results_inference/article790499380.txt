Upon analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques used:

1. Appeal to Authority: The article mentions that Judge Brett Kavanaugh stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him, implying that this is the correct way for someone accused of misconduct to handle the situation.
2. Name Calling/Labeling: The article labels Keith Ellison as an "effeminate pansy" who doesn't want to answer to the American people, which is a clear example of name calling and labeling.
3. Repetition: The article repeats the claim that Judge Kavanaugh faced accusations without addressing the allegations made against him, trying to equate his situation with Ellison's.
4. Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring: The article tries to discredit the women who accused Ellison by bringing up a past incident where Amy Alexandar claimed Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her. This is an attempt to shift focus away from the current allegations against Ellison.
5. Doubt: The article raises doubts about the credibility of the women who accused Ellison, implying that they might be motivated by political gain.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
