I have analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques mentioned earlier. Based on my analysis, I found some instances of Loaded Language and Exaggeration, Minimization.

Loaded Language:

* The phrase "outrage across the nation" is an example of loaded language, as it implies a widespread reaction that may not be entirely accurate.
* The description of Guyger's actions as "devastated" by her colleague is also an example of loaded language, as it presents her emotional state in a sympathetic light.

Exaggeration, Minimization:

* The statement "In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody" is an exaggeration, as it implies that anyone who makes a similar mistake would be arrested immediately. This may not be true in every situation.
* The description of Guyger's 2017 shooting as "another suspect" is a minimization, as it downplays the seriousness of the incident and presents Guyger as a victim rather than an aggressor.

Please note that these instances are subjective and open to interpretation. I did not find any other propaganda techniques in the article.
