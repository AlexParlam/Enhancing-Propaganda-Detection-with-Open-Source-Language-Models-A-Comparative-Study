I analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques, and here are my findings:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article labels Keith Ellison as a "Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser". This is an example of name calling.
2. **Flag-Waving**: The article uses phrases like "patriotic duty" and "justice and vote", which are meant to evoke strong national feelings.

As for the rest of the techniques, I didn't detect any other propaganda tactics in this article.
