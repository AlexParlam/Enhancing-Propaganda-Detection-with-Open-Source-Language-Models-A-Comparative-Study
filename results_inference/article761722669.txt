After analyzing the article, I found several instances of propaganda techniques used by Bill Clinton and his co-author James Patterson:

1. **Labeling**: When Clinton says "I apologized to everybody in the world," he is labeling himself as someone who has made amends for past mistakes.
2. **Repetition**: Clinton repeats the phrase "20 years ago" multiple times, emphasizing that the events are ancient history and no longer relevant.
3. **Whataboutism**: Patterson uses this technique when comparing Clinton's affairs to those of JFK and LBJ, attempting to discredit the interviewer (Craig Melvin) by implying that he is being unfair or overly critical.
4. **Straw Men**: Clinton creates a straw man argument by saying "You think President Kennedy should have resigned? Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned?" This is an attempt to deflect criticism and turn the conversation into a discussion about historical figures rather than his own actions.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques in this article.
