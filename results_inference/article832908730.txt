After analyzing the article, I detected a few propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Authority**: The article quotes Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) calling for transparency, which can be seen as an appeal to authority.
2. **Repetition**: The article repeats the phrase "Russia investigation" multiple times, likely to reinforce its significance in the reader's mind.

No other propaganda techniques were detected.
