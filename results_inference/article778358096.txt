After analyzing the article, I found several instances of propaganda techniques being used:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The author appeals to fear by suggesting that the actions of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and others are indicative of a larger problem with Muslims and Islam, implying that all Muslims who follow the Koran are radical and oppressive.
2. **Red Herring**: The author uses the phrase "nice Muslim people" to distract from the actual issue at hand, which is the alleged involvement of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj in training children for school shootings.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, repetition, whataboutism, straw men, or bandwagon appeals.
