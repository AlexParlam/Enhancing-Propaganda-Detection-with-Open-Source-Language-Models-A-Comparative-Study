I detect several instances of propaganda techniques in this article.

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The article appeals to fear by warning about the dangers of online radicalization and manipulation.
2. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: The author presents a misleading narrative about Tommy Robinson and his views, attempting to discredit him without directly disproving his arguments.
3. **Labeling**: The article labels certain individuals or groups as "violent extremists" or "extremists," which is likely meant to evoke negative emotions in the audience.
4. **Repetition**: The author repeats their claims about Bharath Ganesh's biased research and its implications, trying to make them more believable through repetition.
5. **Reductio ad Hitlerum**: The article attempts to equate Tommy Robinson with white supremacism and racism, which is an unfair and misleading comparison.

Overall, the article appears to be promoting a particular agenda or ideology by using these propaganda techniques.
