I analyzed the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques listed and found some instances:

1. **Loaded Language**: Phrases such as "cold-blooded killing", "threat to society", and "pillar of society" are used to evoke strong emotions and create a negative image of Amber Guyger.
2. **Flag-Waving**: The article uses national sentiment by emphasizing that the victim, Botham Jean, was an innocent man who was killed in his own home, appealing to readers' sense of justice and patriotism.
3. **Whataboutism/Straw Men/Red Herring**: The article presents a counterpoint to Chief Hall's claims about not being able to fire Amber Guyger by highlighting examples of other police officers being fired for similar reasons. This is an attempt to discredit the chief's position without directly disproving it.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
