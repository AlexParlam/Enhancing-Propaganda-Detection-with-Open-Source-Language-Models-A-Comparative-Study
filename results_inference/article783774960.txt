After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques used:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of emotive language such as "jihadis", "mass school shootings", and "coverup" creates a strong emotional impact on the audience.
2. **Whataboutism/Straw Men/Red Herring**: The author attempts to discredit the New Mexico district attorney by implying that he is not doing his job properly, without directly disproving his actions or arguments.
3. **Bandwagon**: The author encourages readers to question President Trump's involvement and potential firing of Sessions, implying that it's a popular opinion among those who are concerned about justice.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in the article.
