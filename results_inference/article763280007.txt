After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The article builds support for Geert Wilders' message by instilling anxiety and panic in the audience towards an alternative (i.e., the alleged threat of Islamization and mass immigration).
2. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The author labels certain groups or individuals as "authoritarian," "totalitarian," and "supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state" without providing direct evidence.
3. **Repetition**: The article repeats the message that Geert Wilders is a hero who dares to speak truth to power, and that his message will ultimately prevail.
4. **Whataboutism**: The author attempts to discredit the British government by charging them with hypocrisy for allowing Geert Wilders into the country while banning others (Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern, and Lutz Bachmann).
5. **Red Herring**: The article introduces irrelevant examples of Muslim preachers being allowed into the country as a distraction from the main issue.

No propaganda technique is detected in the following areas:

* Emotional appeals
* Loaded language
* Bandwagon effect (although it can be argued that Geert Wilders' message is presented as popular among those who share his views)
* Straw men

Note: It's not possible to detect all types of propaganda techniques without further information or context.
