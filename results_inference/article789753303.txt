After analyzing the article for any of the 14 propaganda techniques, I detected the following:

1. **Loaded Language**: Phrases such as "outrage erupted", "rightfully so", and "utterly preposterous" are used to evoke strong emotions in the reader.
2. **Repetition**: The phrase "Guyger has finally been fired" is repeated multiple times to emphasize the significance of the event.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques, including Name Calling/Labeling, Flag-Waving, Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring, or Bandwagon.
