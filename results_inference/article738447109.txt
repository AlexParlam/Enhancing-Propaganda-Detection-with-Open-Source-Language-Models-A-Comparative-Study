After analyzing the article for 14 propaganda techniques, I detected the following:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article uses name-calling when referring to Gina Haspel as "torturer" and describes her actions as "horrific torture of detainees."
2. **Loaded Language**: The language used is emotive, describing torture as "horrific" and highlighting the gruesome nature of the methods used.
3. **Exaggeration/Minimization**: While not explicitly stated, the article implies that Haspel's past involvement in torture is a significant concern, potentially exaggerating its importance.
4. **Appeal to Emotion**: The article aims to evoke emotions by describing the brutal treatment of detainees and highlighting the controversial nature of Haspel's appointment.

The article presents a critical view of Gina Haspel's appointment as CIA director, emphasizing her involvement in torture during the Bush era. While not inherently propagandistic, the language used is emotive and sensationalized, which may influence readers' perceptions and reactions to this news story.
