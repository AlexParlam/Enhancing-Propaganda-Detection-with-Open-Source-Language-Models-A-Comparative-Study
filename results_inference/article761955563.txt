After analyzing the article, I detected the following propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article labels the Sharia as being "implemented in the United Kingdom" and Muslims as wanting to seek "total control", which is a pejorative label that evokes negative emotions.
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "Sharia is being implemented", "Muslims are ready to seek total control", and "Britain, the cradle of Western democracy and the rule of law, is fast descending into tyranny" use loaded language to create a sense of fear and alarm.

These techniques aim to influence the audience's emotions and perceptions by labeling or describing things in a way that elicits a strong reaction.
