I've analyzed the article and found several propaganda techniques used:

1. **Exaggeration/Minimization**: The article exaggerates the significance of finding a small amount of weed in Jean's apartment while minimizing Guyger's culpability in Jean's death.
2. **Emotional Appeal**: The article appeals to readers' emotions by highlighting the injustices suffered by Jean and his family, as well as the perceived mistreatment of Guyger.
3. **Loaded Language**: The article uses loaded language such as "homicidal cop," "killer cop," and "smear campaign" to create a negative image of Guyger and the police department.
4. **Misdirection**: The article diverts attention from Guyger's actions leading up to Jean's death by focusing on perceived injustices against her and the police department.

Overall, while the article presents some valid points, it also employs several propaganda techniques to sway readers' opinions and create a specific narrative about the event.
