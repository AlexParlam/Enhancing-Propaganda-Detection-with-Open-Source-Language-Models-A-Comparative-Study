I didn't detect any propaganda techniques used in this article. The article appears to be a factual report of the shooting and subsequent arrests, including quotes from authorities and statements from the families of the victims. While there may be some emotional language and reactions from officials, the tone seems to be one of objective reporting rather than persuasive or manipulative.
