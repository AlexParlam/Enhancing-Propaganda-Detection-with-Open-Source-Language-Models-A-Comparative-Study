Here's a helpful answer:

The article describes Keith Ellison, a Democratic politician and candidate for Attorney General in Minnesota, as having a history of supporting cop killers and promoting violence against police officers. The author argues that this is a significant concern given Ellison's potential role as the top law enforcement official in the state.

Ellison has been criticized for his past support of Sharif Willis, the leader of the Vice Lords gang responsible for the murder of Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf. Additionally, he has spoken out in favor of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop killer, and Assata Shakur, who is wanted for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.

The author suggests that Ellison's support for these individuals raises serious questions about his fitness to hold public office, particularly as Attorney General. The article implies that Ellison's willingness to use the police to shield himself from scrutiny by the press is hypocritical and inconsistent with his claimed commitment to social justice.

Overall, the article presents a critical examination of Keith Ellison's record on issues related to law enforcement and public safety, suggesting that he may not be a suitable candidate for Attorney General.
