I analyzed the article for any of 14 propaganda techniques and found several:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: "Self-proclaimed 'fact checkers'", "lying media", "Communist teeth" - labeling certain groups or individuals in a negative way.
2. **Repetition**: Repeating phrases like "you're lying" and "lies and propaganda" to emphasize the point.
3. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: Accusing CNN and other media outlets of hypocrisy without directly disproving their argument (e.g., "How can you criticize this administration's policy when your own party had similar issues?").
4. **Bandwagon Effect**: Using phrases like "it is one of the clearest demonstrations" to create a sense of urgency and agreement with the author's viewpoint.
5. **Appeal to Emotion**: Using emotional language like "hilarious", "complete fabrication", and "total dishonesty" to create an emotional response in the reader.

These techniques are used to manipulate the reader's perception and reinforce the author's point of view, rather than presenting a balanced or objective argument.
