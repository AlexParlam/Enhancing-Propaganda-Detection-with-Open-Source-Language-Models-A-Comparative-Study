The article appears to employ the propaganda technique of "2 Appeal to Prejudice" by building support for a idea (in this case, skepticism towards the defendants' actions) by instilling anxiety and panic in the audience towards an alternative (i.e., if the suspects were white Christians). The quote from Thomas Clark, defense attorney, explicitly states that if the suspects were white Christians, no one would care about their actions. This is an attempt to sway public opinion against the defendants based on their perceived racial and religious differences.

Additionally, the article also employs "10 Name Calling/Labeling" by giving a label ("violent extremists") to the object of the propaganda campaign as something that is hated or feared.

No other propaganda techniques are detected in this article.
