After analyzing the article, I did not detect any of the 14 propaganda techniques mentioned earlier (10 Name Calling/Labeling, 11 Repetition, 14 Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring, 4 Black-and-White Fallacy, 5 Causal Oversimplification, and 3 Bandwagon, Reductio ad Hitlerum).

The article appears to be a factual report on the election results in Georgia, featuring quotes from both Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp. The language used is objective and neutral, without any attempts to manipulate or persuade the reader.
