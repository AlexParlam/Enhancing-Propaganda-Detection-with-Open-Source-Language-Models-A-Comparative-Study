I analyzed the article and detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Labeling**: The article labels Judge Totenberg as an "Obama Judge," which is a form of labeling that aims to evoke a negative emotional response from readers who dislike President Obama.
2. **Repetition**: The article repeats the claim that the election results are uncertain, with phrases like "One down three to go" and "21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the state during the midterm." This repetition creates a sense of uncertainty and keeps readers engaged.
3. **Red Herring**: The article mentions Jim Acosta's press pass controversy at the end, which seems unrelated to the main topic of the election. This is an attempt to distract readers from the real issue and create a false equivalence between two different topics.
4. **Whataboutism**: The article quotes Brian Kemp saying it's "mathematically impossible" for Abrams' campaign to force a runoff, without directly addressing the concerns raised by Abrams or providing evidence to support this claim.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in the article.
