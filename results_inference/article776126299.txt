After analyzing the article, I found some examples of propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The author creates anxiety in the audience by suggesting that the release of 3D-printed gun plans will lead to a risk of terrorist attacks and jeopardize public safety.
2. **Repetition**: The author repeats the idea that the states' rights are being infringed upon, emphasizing that the Trump Administration's decision is a threat to the system meant to keep firearms out of dangerous individuals' hands.

These techniques aim to build support for the author's argument by instilling anxiety and panic in the audience towards an alternative (the release of 3D-printed gun plans) and by repeating their message to make it more believable.
