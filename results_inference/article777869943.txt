After analyzing the article for 14 propaganda techniques, I found that there are no instances of these techniques being used. The article appears to be a straightforward news report about the discovery of a compound in New Mexico and the subsequent investigation into the disappearance of a young boy. There is no evidence of exaggeration, minimization, black-and-white fallacies, causal oversimplification, name calling/labeling, or repetition.

Therefore, my answer is: "no propaganda detected".
