After analyzing the article, I detected some propaganda techniques used by Bill Clinton:

1. **Exaggeration**: When Clinton says he "did the right thing" and "defended the Constitution," he's exaggerating his actions to make them sound more noble.
2. **Red Herring**: By pointing out the sexual misconduct allegations against President Trump, Clinton is attempting to distract from the topic at hand (his affair with Lewinsky) and discredit his opponent.
3. **Labeling**: Clinton labels himself as someone who "did the right thing" and is not beholden to apologize for his actions, implying that his audience should view him in a positive light.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques used by Bill Clinton or others mentioned in the article.

So, my answer is: detected.
