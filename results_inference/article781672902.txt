A scathing critique of the US political system, the "Russiagate" investigation, and the role of the media (or "presstitutes") in shaping public opinion. The author, Paul Craig Roberts, is a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan and a well-known critic of government policies.

Roberts' argument is that the Trump presidency has been marked by a coordinated effort to undermine his legitimacy and ultimately remove him from office through false accusations and manipulation of the media narrative. He suggests that the "Russiagate" investigation, led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, is not a genuine attempt to uncover Russian interference in the 2016 election, but rather a political ploy designed to influence the midterm elections and create an atmosphere in which Trump's impeachment becomes increasingly likely.

Roberts also critiques the media for its role in perpetuating this narrative, describing them as "presstitutes" who are more interested in advancing their own agendas than in presenting balanced or accurate reporting. He argues that the media's failure to question the validity of the "Russiagate" investigation and its sources has contributed to the perpetuation of a false narrative that is damaging to American political discourse.

Overall, Roberts' piece is a passionate indictment of the US political system and the role of the media in shaping public opinion. While his views may be controversial, they reflect a growing sense of disillusionment with the way politics are conducted in Washington and the perceived bias of the mainstream media.
