After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of emotive language such as "Unbelievable!", "Sharia New Mexico", "Injustice!", and "Shame!" is designed to elicit a strong emotional response from the audience.
2. **Flag-Waving**: The article appeals to nationalism by using phrases like "Sharia trumps dead children" and implying that there is a double standard in the justice system, creating a sense of patriotism among readers.
3. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The author labels the suspects as "extremist Muslim" and their lawyer's argument as an example of "Islamophobia", which is designed to create a negative perception of Muslims and Islam.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
