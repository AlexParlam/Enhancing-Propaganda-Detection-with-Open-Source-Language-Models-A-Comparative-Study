I analyzed the article and detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Authority**: The article quotes Sarah Sanders, White House Press Secretary, who claims that Acosta's behavior was "absolutely unacceptable." This appeal to authority is used to support the Trump administration's decision to revoke Acosta's press credentials.
2. **Labeling**: The article labels CNN and Acosta as victims of a violation of their First Amendment rights, trying to evoke sympathy from the audience.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques in this article.
