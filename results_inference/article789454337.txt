I detected several propaganda techniques used in this article:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The term "blue privilege" is used to label the situation, implying that police officers receive special treatment simply because of their profession.
2. **Black-and-White Fallacy**: The article presents two alternatives: Guyger's apartment was either searched or not searched, with no mention of other possible scenarios.
3. **Causal Oversimplification**: The article suggests that Guyger's apartment was not searched intentionally to see her get away with the crime, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decision.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
