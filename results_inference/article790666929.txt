After analyzing the article, I detected the following propaganda techniques:

1. **Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring**: The text questions the motives of the people trying to unseal Keith Ellison's divorce records, implying that they are doing it for political gain and not out of genuine concern for the public interest.
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "lawless party" and "corrupt party in Chicago" carry strong emotional impact and aim to create a negative association with the opposing party.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, or 7.
