After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques used:

1. **Loaded Language**: The use of phrases like "world-on-fire", "Russians everywhere", and "regime change" carries strong emotional impact to affect the audience.
2. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The comparison of Pompeo's views on Russia with those of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is an attempt to label him as someone who shares their views, implying that he is part of a group that the audience might not like.
3. **Flag-Waving**: The article tries to play on strong national feeling by emphasizing the importance of supporting Trump's decisions and the need for patriotism.
4. **Exaggeration/Minimization**: The description of Haspel's involvement in torture as "extensive" and the emphasis on her role in destroying interrogation tapes are attempts to exaggerate her complicity, while the dismissal of her past actions as simply a "management shake-up" is an attempt to minimize their significance.
5. **Whataboutism/Straw Men**: The article questions the credibility of Pompeo's views on Russia by comparing them to those of Clinton and Obama, rather than directly addressing his arguments.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
