After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Loaded Language**: The article uses strong emotional language to describe Amber Guyger's actions and treatment by law enforcement, such as "killing an innocent man" and "special treatment."
2. **Flag-Waving**: The article appeals to a sense of national feeling by mentioning the Dallas Cowboys' stadium and evoking emotions about racial injustice.
3. **Bandwagon, Reductio ad Hitlerum**: The article implies that everyone else is criticizing Amber Guyger's actions, creating a sense of consensus around her guilt.
4. **Whataboutism**: The article presents Jean's family as victims of police brutality and asks readers to empathize with them, rather than addressing the specific claims made in the article.

No other propaganda techniques were detected.
