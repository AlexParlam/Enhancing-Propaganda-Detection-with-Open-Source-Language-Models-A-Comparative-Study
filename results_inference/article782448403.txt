After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques used by the author:

1. Appeal to Authority: The author quotes a federal judge's decision as evidence to support their argument.
2. Black-and-White Fallacy: The author presents two alternative options as the only possibilities: either the Trump administration gave the green light to distribute 3D gun blueprints or California General Xavier Becerra is lying. However, there might be more options or nuances that are not presented.

I did not detect any other propaganda techniques in this article.
