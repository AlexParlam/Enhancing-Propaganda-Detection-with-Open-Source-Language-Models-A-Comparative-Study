I detected several propaganda techniques used in this article:

1. **Black-And-White Fallacy**: The author presents two alternatives as the only possibilities, when actually more options exist. In this case, the author suggests that if the officers had survived and the suspect had died, the race issue would be emphasized, implying that it's only relevant when the situation is reversed.
2. **Reductio ad Hitlerum** (Bandwagon): The author uses a hypothetical scenario to compare the current event with another situation where they believe the race issue was emphasized. This tactic aims to discredit the original reporting by associating it with an unfavorable or extreme example.
3. **Whataboutism**: The author questions why the race of the suspect is not mentioned in the original report, implying that if the officers had survived and the suspect had died, the race would be highlighted.

These techniques are used to create a biased narrative and manipulate the reader's perception.
