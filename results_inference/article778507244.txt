After analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques used:

1. **Whataboutism**: The article attempts to discredit Linda Sarsour by linking her mentor's alleged involvement in a plot to commit school shootings.
2. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The article labels Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his followers as "extremist of the Muslim belief," implying that Muslims are somehow associated with terrorism or extremism.
3. **Exaggeration, Minimization**: The description of the New Mexico compound as "filthy" may be an exaggeration to create a negative image in the reader's mind.

No other propaganda techniques were detected in this article.
