Upon analyzing the article, I detected several propaganda techniques:

1. **Name Calling/Labeling**: The author labels the defense's argument as "freedom of religion" and claims that it is an excuse for "islamophobia."
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "squalid New Mexico compound," "ruthless corporation," and "jihad slaughter" are used to evoke strong emotions in the reader.
3. **Flag-Waving**: The article plays on national feeling by referencing American values such as freedom of religion and patriotism.

There is no evidence of other propaganda techniques, such as Repetition, Bandwagon, Reductio ad Hitlerum, Whataboutism, Straw Men, or Red Herring, in this article.
