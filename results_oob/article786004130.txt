After analyzing the article, I have identified several propaganda techniques used:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The use of phrases such as "outrage across the nation" and "devastated" aims to evoke emotions in the reader, making them more invested in the story.

2. **Repetition**: The repeated mention of Guyger's mistake ("she entered an apartment she claims that she thought was hers") and the phrase "officer's account" reinforces the idea that this is a factual, objective report, which can make it seem more convincing.

3. **Questioning the Reader**: Phrases like "I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly" and "Is this something people are prone to do at 10 o'clock at night in Dallas?" encourage readers to think critically about the situation and potentially question their own assumptions or behaviors, which can create a sense of shared experience and empathy with the author.

4. **Framing**: The article frames Guyger's actions as a mistake rather than a deliberate act, portraying her as a victim of circumstance rather than a perpetrator. This framing influences how readers perceive the situation and may affect their emotional response to it.

5. **Contrast**: By highlighting Guyger's previous shooting incident in 2017 and the differing outcomes (she was not arrested then), the article creates a sense of contrast between her treatment in this case and what might be expected if an ordinary person had committed a similar mistake, further emphasizing the perceived injustices.

6. **Appeal to Authority**: The inclusion of official statements from the Dallas Police Department and the District Attorney's Office adds credibility to the report and may increase readers' trust in the information presented.

7. **Distracting Information**: The mention of other news stories, such as Nikki Haley leaving her position as Ambassador to the U.N., serves as a distraction from the main topic and creates a sense of broader relevance, making the story more engaging for readers.

No other propaganda techniques were identified beyond these seven.
