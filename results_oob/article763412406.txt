Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Bandwagon effect**: The article presents a large crowd gathering to support Tommy Robinson, which creates an impression that many people agree with his cause and are willing to take action.

2. **Appeal to emotion**: The article uses emotional language, such as "tyrannical arrest" and "crimes against his country", to create sympathy for Tommy Robinson's situation and elicit an emotional response from the reader.

3. **Testimonial evidence**: The article presents quotes and statements from various speakers at the rally, including Geert Wilders, Gerard Batten, Anne Marie Waters, and Raheem Kassam, which serves as a form of social proof and lends credibility to their messages.

4. **Rhetorical questions**: Waters' rhetorical questions ("Why is it so easy...") are meant to elicit an emotional response and create a sense of injustice, rather than providing factual information or encouraging critical thinking.

5. **Fear-mongering**: The article presents a narrative that the British government is complicit in crimes committed by Muslims and that Islamization poses a threat to British culture and way of life, which aims to instill fear in readers and create a sense of urgency around the issue.

6. **Divisive rhetoric**: The article uses language that pits Muslims against non-Muslims, implying that they are fundamentally opposed and that one is superior to the other. This type of rhetoric can foster animosity and division between groups.

7. **Unsubstantiated claims**: Waters makes unsubstantiated claims about the frequency and severity of crimes committed by Muslims in the UK, which creates a distorted view of reality and lacks factual support.

8. **Appeal to authority**: The article presents speakers at the rally as authorities on the topic, rather than providing evidence or credible sources to back up their claims.
