Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The article starts with a dramatic and emotive statement ("Highlighting the sheer insane state of law enforcement in America today...") to grab the reader's attention.
2. **Bandwagon Effect**: By stating that this is "the first time" reporting on such an incident, the author implies that readers are part of a movement or community that demands justice and transparency.
3. **Repetition**: The phrase "not arrested yet" is repeated multiple times to emphasize the perceived injustice and create a sense of outrage among readers.
4. **False Dichotomy**: By framing the situation as either "police officers entering the wrong home during raids and killing, maiming, or traumatizing entirely innocent people" versus this specific incident, the author creates an oversimplified binary opposition that reinforces their narrative.
5. **Loaded Language**: The use of words like "insane", "scary", and "slap to the face" is designed to evoke strong emotions in readers, rather than presenting a balanced view of the situation.
6. **Appeal to Empathy**: The article humanizes the victim by quoting his mother's reaction ("He did no one any wrong") and emphasizing the tragic consequences for his family.

Note that these techniques are not necessarily malicious or intentionally manipulative; they may be intended to raise awareness and stimulate discussion about important issues. However, as a neutral AI observer, I must point out their potential impact on readers' perceptions and opinions.
