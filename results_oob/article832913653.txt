Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to patriotism**: "The patriotic action for the Attorney General is to release the entire Mueller Report to the American people." (John Delaney) - This phrase appeals to readers' sense of national pride and loyalty, implying that releasing the report is a necessary step for maintaining America's integrity.
* **Emotional appeal**: "The American people deserve to know its findings." (Kirsten Gillibrand), "Release the Mueller report to the American people." (Beto O'Rourke) - These statements aim to elicit an emotional response from readers, framing the report's release as a matter of national importance and democratic accountability.
* **Repetition**: Multiple candidates, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro, and John Delaney, all call for the report to be released publicly. This repetition creates a sense of consensus and amplifies the message.
* **Fear-mongering**: The article implies that hiding the report's findings could lead to "foreign interference in our democracy" (Julian Castro) - This creates a sense of urgency and fear among readers, encouraging them to support the release of the report as a means of protecting national security.

Please note that these techniques are not necessarily malicious or manipulative; they can be used to persuade and educate people about important issues.
