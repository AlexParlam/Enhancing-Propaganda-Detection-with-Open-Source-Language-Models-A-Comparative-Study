After analyzing the article, I have identified the following propaganda techniques:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The article uses emotional language to elicit feelings of outrage and sympathy for Botham Jean's family. Phrases like "murdered in his apartment", "smear campaign", "homicidal cop" are designed to evoke strong emotions.

2. **Loaded Language**: The article uses loaded terms like "killer cop", "homicidal cop", and "smear campaign" to create a negative connotation around the police department's actions.

3. **Confirmation Bias**: The article presents only one side of the story, focusing on the alleged flaws in Officer Amber Guyger's account and ignoring any potential contradictions or mitigating circumstances that may have contributed to the shooting.

4. **Bandwagon Effect**: The article implies that most people are not buying the police department's explanation, creating a sense of momentum and social pressure to agree with their narrative.

5. **Appeal to Consequences**: The article warns that if the police department's smear campaign is successful, it will "work most of the time" and create an atmosphere where law enforcement can get away with similar actions in the future.

6. **Straw Man Argument**: The article presents a simplified and exaggerated version of the police department's claims to make them appear more sinister than they actually are.

7. **False Balance**: The article presents only one side of the story, without providing any balance or counterarguments from the police department or other perspectives, which can create an unfair representation of the issue.

8. **Glittering Generalities**: The article uses positive adjectives like "upstanding member of society" to describe Botham Jean, creating a sense of admiration and respect for him.

9. **Appeal to Fear**: The article warns that if the police department's smear campaign is successful, it will create an atmosphere where law enforcement can get away with similar actions in the future, which can evoke fear and anxiety in readers.

10. **Sensationalism**: The article uses sensational language and headings like "Murdered in his apartment" to grab attention and draw readers in.
