Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Leading questions**: The article frames the issue as a "tense incident" and asks readers if Jim Acosta should have gotten his press pass back, which is a leading question designed to elicit a certain response from the reader.
* **Emotional appeal**: The article uses emotive language to describe the situation, such as "vicious attacks" and "threats", which aims to evoke feelings of sympathy and outrage in readers.
* **Selective presentation of facts**: The article presents only one side of the story, focusing on Acosta's version of events and omitting details that might contradict his narrative. For example, it does not mention the intern's account of the incident or Trump's reactions during the Q&A session.
* **Use of testimonials**: The article features testimonials from Sam Donaldson and Floyd Mayweather, which are presented as objective assessments of the situation. However, these individuals have a vested interest in supporting CNN and Acosta, which may influence their opinions.
* **Loaded language**: The article uses loaded language to describe Trump's behavior, such as "rightfully losing his patience" or "forcefully push[ing] the female intern's arm away from the mic". This language is designed to elicit a negative response from readers and portray Trump in a poor light.
* **False dichotomy**: The article presents a false dichotomy by framing the issue as either Acosta being unfairly targeted or Trump losing his temper. This oversimplifies the situation and ignores potential nuances or alternative perspectives.
