Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

• **Emotional Appeal**: Bill Clinton's statement "I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it" is an attempt to elicit sympathy from the audience, making them feel sorry for him.

• **Appeal to Authority**: By citing his public apology during the National Prayer Breakfast, Clinton establishes himself as a credible source, implying that his apology was sincere and sufficient.

• **Simple Solution**: Clinton's assertion that "a public apology [was] enough" presents a simplistic solution to complex issues like workplace harassment and abuse of power. This minimizes the harm caused by his actions and implies that a single apology can resolve all problems.

• **Diversion**: By bringing up his debt from defending himself against impeachment, Clinton shifts attention away from his personal conduct and focuses on the perceived injustice he suffered.

• **Self-Justification**: Clinton's statement "I dealt with it 20 years ago plus … I've tried to do a good job since then with my life and my work" serves as self-justification, downplaying the significance of his past actions and emphasizing his supposed redemption.

• **Silencing Opponents**: Lewinsky's tweet about being grateful for people who have helped her evolve is an apparent response to Clinton's interview. This could be seen as a way to silence her critics and prevent further discussion on the topic.
