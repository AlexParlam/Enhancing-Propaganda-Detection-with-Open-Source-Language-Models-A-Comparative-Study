Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article starts with an emotional appeal by highlighting the tragedy of a missing boy and the discovery of his remains at a New Mexico compound.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: The article creates a sense of urgency by claiming that many people are unaware of the true nature of Islam, implying that readers should join the "right" side and condemn Islam as a totalitarian religion.
* **Ad Hominem Attack**: The author attacks the mosque spokesman Ali Abdul-Karim Judan's credibility by labeling his narrative as a attempt to change the story because Muslims are involved.
* **False Equivalence**: The article implies that there is no difference between mainstream Muslims and radical Muslims, stating that "you will not find radicals, but devout Muslims" among those who follow the Koran and Muhammad's teachings.
* **Loaded Language**: The author uses loaded language to describe Islam as a "totalitarian, religious/Political construct that is full of oppression", which creates a negative perception of the religion.
* **Fear-Mongering**: The article ends with a sense of fear-mongering by implying that if readers do not take action, they will be putting their heads in the sand and ignoring the truth about Islam.

Please note that these propaganda techniques are identified based on my analysis of the language used in the article. However, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and fact-check information before making judgments or taking action.
