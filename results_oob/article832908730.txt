Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Emphasizing the positive**: The article starts by highlighting the conclusion of the investigation and the submission of the report to the Justice Department, framing it as a significant event that will bring clarity to the situation.
* **Downplaying controversy**: The article mentions Trump's denial of wrongdoing and his branding of the probe as a "total witch hunt," but frames these comments as Trump being defensive rather than as evidence of malfeasance.
* **Using vague language**: The article describes Mueller's report as "confidential" and doesn't provide details about what it contains, which could be intended to create an air of mystery or intrigue around the report's contents.
* **Creating a sense of urgency**: The article notes that Barr may release two separate reports and creates a sense of anticipation by suggesting that Congress and the public will soon learn more about the investigation's findings.
