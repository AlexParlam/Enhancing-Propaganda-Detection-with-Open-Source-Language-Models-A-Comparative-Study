Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to Emotion**: Clinton appeals to emotion by saying he "did the right thing" and defended the Constitution. This evokes a sense of patriotism and moral righteousness.
* **False Equivalence**: By comparing his situation to that of President Trump, Clinton creates a false equivalence between the two. This distracts from the actual issue at hand and makes it seem like both situations are equally valid or invalid.
* **Victim Blaming**: When asked if he owed Lewinsky an apology, Clinton says "I have never talked to her." This implies that Lewinsky is somehow responsible for not receiving an apology because she didn't initiate a conversation with him. This shifts the focus from his own actions to her perceived shortcomings.
* **Half-Truths**: Clinton mentions that he publicly acknowledged his "sin" at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1998, implying that this was some kind of sincere apology. However, it's not clear what exactly he said or how it was received by Lewinsky and others affected by the affair.
* **Misdirection**: By talking about Trump's alleged misdeeds, Clinton diverts attention from his own actions and the consequences they had for Lewinsky.
