Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article appeals to emotions by using phrases such as "menace to society", "waste all my time", and "nothing short of a menace to society". These statements aim to evoke feelings of fear, anxiety, and urgency.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: The article mentions the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calling 3D-printed firearms "a menace to society" and Kris Brown stating that "the debate is over". This creates a sense of inevitability and reinforces the idea that one should join the majority in opposing Cody Wilson's efforts.
* **False Dilemma**: The article presents a false dilemma by implying that either Cody Wilson can publish the blueprints or they will be banned. This oversimplifies the issue and ignores alternative solutions.
* **Appeal to Fear**: The article highlights potential dangers, such as untraceable plastic weapons falling into the wrong hands, which aims to create fear and anxiety in readers.
* **Misdirection**: The article mentions the White House's statement that existing law already prohibits plastic firearms, which may distract from the main issue at hand â€“ Cody Wilson's efforts to publish the blueprints.
* **Rhetorical Question**: The article poses rhetorical questions like "What I'm doing is legally protected. What I'm doing is morally right." This aims to create a sense of moral superiority and justify Cody Wilson's actions.

Note that these propaganda techniques are not necessarily malicious or intentionally manipulative, but rather reflect the natural biases and perspectives present in the article.
