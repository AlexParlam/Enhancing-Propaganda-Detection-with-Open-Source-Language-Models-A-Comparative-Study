Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **False equivalence**: The article attempts to create a false equivalency between Keith Ellison's situation and Brett Kavanaugh's by stating that "Of course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation." This implies that both cases are equally scrutinized and investigated, which is not true.

2. **Emotional appeal**: The use of phrases such as "Well, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh" and "it's hard to know what really happened in a relationship" aims to elicit emotions from the reader, rather than providing objective information.

3. **Misdirection**: The article focuses on the fact that Karen Monahan filed a police report, implying that it is a key piece of evidence against Ellison, without presenting any additional context or details about the allegations.

4. **Lack of neutrality**: The article's tone and language are clearly biased against Keith Ellison, with phrases such as "accused woman abuser" and "effeminate pansy" that aim to discredit him rather than present a balanced view.

5. ** cherry-picking information**: The article selectively presents information that supports its narrative while ignoring or downplaying other relevant facts, such as the fact that the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired an attorney to conduct an investigation.

6. **Ad hominem attacks**: The use of phrases like "effeminate pansy" is a classic example of ad hominem attack, which aims to discredit Ellison's character rather than address the allegations made against him.

7. **Appeal to authority**: The article quotes Dave Weigel as saying that "the story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny," implying that it is an authoritative source confirming the veracity of the story.

8. **Disinformation**: The article makes a false statement about Amy Alexandar's allegations against Ellison, stating that she tried to get a restraining order against him after he filed one against her. In reality, Alexandar had already filed for a restraining order against Ellison before he filed his own.

9. **Red herring**: The article raises the issue of Judge Kavanaugh's situation as a red herring, aiming to distract readers from the allegations made against Ellison and create a false equivalency between the two cases.
