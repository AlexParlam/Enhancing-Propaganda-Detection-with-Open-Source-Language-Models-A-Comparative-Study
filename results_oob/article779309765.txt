After analyzing the article, I identified several propaganda techniques:

1. **Emotional Manipulation**: The article starts with an attention-grabbing headline ("Unbelievable!") and uses emotive language throughout to create a sense of outrage and indignation in the reader.

2. **Loaded Language**: Terms like "Islamic compound jihadis," "sharia trumps dead children," and "Islamophobia" are used to create a negative connotation around Islam and Muslims.

3. **False Equivalence**: The article suggests that if the suspects had been Christian and white, they would have received harsher treatment. This implies that Christianity and whiteness are inherently better than Islam and blackness, which is a false equivalence.

4. ** cherry-picking Information**: The article presents a biased view of the case by focusing on the alleged child abuse and neglect without providing a balanced perspective on the suspects' motivations or the possible reasons behind their actions.

5. **Strawman Argument**: The defense attorney's argument that there was a double standard is portrayed as absurd, implying that anyone who points out systemic biases is wrong.

6. **Appeal to Authority**: The article quotes Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe and prosecutors to present their perspective on the case, lending credibility to their claims.

7. **Scare Tactic**: The article implies that the suspects were planning attacks and that the children found at the compound were being trained to harm others, which is not explicitly supported by the evidence presented in the article.

8. **False Causality**: The article suggests that Judge Sarah Backus's decision was influenced by "Islamophobia," implying a causal link between her religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and her judicial decision.

9. **Appeal to Consequences**: The article ends with a dire warning about the consequences of not taking action against the suspects, creating a sense of urgency and fear in the reader.

10. **Misdirection**: The article's focus on the suspects' religion and Judge Backus's alleged "Islamophobia" distracts from other important facts or potential explanations for the case.
