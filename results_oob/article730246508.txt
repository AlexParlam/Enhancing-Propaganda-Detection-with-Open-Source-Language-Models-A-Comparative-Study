No propaganda detected.

However, some techniques that could be considered as potentially propagandistic are:

* Emotional appeals: The article uses phrases such as "true American heroes", "dedicated", and "will be so greatly missed" to create an emotional response in the reader.
* Reiteration of key messages: The article repeats the phrase "true tragedy" multiple times, which could be seen as a way to emphasize the severity of the event and elicit sympathy from the reader.
* Use of authority figures: The inclusion of quotes from high-ranking officials such as President Trump, Governor Kasich, and Police Commissioner O'Neill could be seen as an attempt to lend credibility to the story and amplify its emotional impact.
* Selective presentation of information: The article focuses primarily on the victims and the reactions of authorities, with minimal attention given to the suspect or the circumstances surrounding the shooting. This selective presentation could be seen as a way to shape public opinion and create a particular narrative about the event.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not necessarily used in a manipulative or deceptive manner in this article. The story is primarily focused on reporting the facts of the incident, and the use of emotional appeals and authority figures may simply be intended to enhance the impact of the story rather than manipulate public opinion.
