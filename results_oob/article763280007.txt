Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to emotions**: The article uses emotional appeals to persuade readers, such as highlighting the injustice of Tommy Robinson's imprisonment and the need to stand up against tyranny.
* **Bandwagon effect**: The article encourages readers to join a perceived moral crusade against political elites who are allegedly suppressing free speech and promoting Islamization.
* **Fearmongering**: The article creates a sense of fear by suggesting that Britain is becoming an authoritarian police state and that freedom of speech is under threat.
* **Glittering Generalities**: The article uses positive, general terms like "freedom," "democracy," and "civilization" to create a favorable impression of Geert Wilders' views.
* **Loaded language**: The article uses loaded language like "Islamization," "mass immigration," and "open borders" to create a negative connotation around these topics.
* **Name-calling**: The article labels politicians like Theresa May as "relentlessly appeasement-minded" and suggests that they are complicit in promoting Islamization.
* **Scapegoating**: The article portrays political elites as responsible for the problems facing Britain, rather than acknowledging any role that societal factors or individual actions may play.
* **Straw man argument**: The article sets up a false dichotomy between freedom of speech and Islamization, suggesting that opposing Islamization means sacrificing freedom of speech.

Note: These techniques are not necessarily used in an overt or manipulative way throughout the entire article. They are more subtle and may be intended to persuade readers without being explicitly recognized as propaganda.
