After analyzing the article, I identified the following propaganda techniques:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article aims to evoke emotions such as outrage, anger, and sadness by describing the death of a 3-year-old boy and the training of "little jihadis" for mass school shootings.
* **Loaded Language**: Terms like "jihad compound," "terror compound," and "little jihadis" are used to create a negative connotation and associate the individuals involved with terrorism.
* **Misdirection**: The article shifts attention from the original charges being dropped to the FBI's new arrests, implying that the authorities were not doing their job properly before.
* **Appeal to Consequences**: By highlighting the potential consequences of not taking action (e.g., more deaths), the article tries to pressure readers into supporting the FBI's actions.
* **False Balance**: The article presents a critical view of the district attorney's decision to drop charges, implying that it was an unusual or unjust move, without providing a balanced perspective on the situation.
* **Ad Hominem Attack**: The article criticizes the district attorney for his handling of the case, questioning his competence and trustworthiness, rather than focusing on the facts of the case.
* **Appeal to Authority**: The article cites President Trump's involvement in the matter as a way to lend credibility to its claims and imply that he is taking action to address perceived injustices.

Note: These propaganda techniques are not necessarily malicious or intentionally deceitful. However, they can still influence readers' perceptions and opinions by emphasizing certain aspects of the story while downplaying others.
