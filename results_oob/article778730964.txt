Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Appeal to emotions**: The imam's claim that "they hate Islam" is an emotional appeal designed to elicit sympathy and anger towards the media.
2. **Victim mentality**: The imam and his supporters present themselves as victims of a biased media and government, rather than taking responsibility for their actions or the situation at hand.
3. **False equivalence**: By comparing their situation to that of others who are smeared as "anti-Muslim," the imam and his supporters attempt to create an equal moral universe where no one is allowed to criticize Islam or Muslims without being accused of hate-mongering.
4. **Misdirection**: The imam's focus on alleged media bias and "propaganda" against Muslims distracts from the actual issues surrounding the New Mexico compound, including the concerns about child abuse and potential terrorism training.
5. **Appeal to authority**: The article quotes a mosque representative as an authoritative voice, which may be intended to lend credibility to their claims and undermine the legitimacy of opposing viewpoints.

No propaganda techniques are detected in the first paragraph, which simply presents the situation and the imam's reaction.

Note: These techniques may not necessarily be intentional or malicious. However, they do contribute to a biased narrative that prioritizes protecting Islam and Muslims over addressing legitimate concerns about extremism and child welfare.
