After analyzing the article, I identified the following propaganda techniques:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The article aims to elicit emotions such as outrage, sadness, and anger by describing the tragic event of Botham Jean's death and emphasizing the injustice of Amber Guyger's actions.
2. **Simplification**: The article presents a binary view of the situation, portraying Ted Cruz and law enforcement as biased and trying to protect Guyger, while painting Beto O'Rourke and Democrats as champions of justice and accountability.
3. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "repugnant and outright disrespectful move," "innocent 26-year-old pillar of society," and "wrong" are used to create a negative connotation around Cruz's actions and to emphasize the gravity of Jean's death.
4. **False Equivalence**: The article claims that if the roles were reversed, police and Ted Cruz would also treat the situation as a tragic accident, implying that there is no bias in their response. However, this is not supported by evidence and may be intended to create an illusion of fairness.
5. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: The article states that law enforcement have been trying to protect Guyger since the beginning without providing concrete evidence or credible sources to support this claim.
6. **Omission**: The article does not provide a balanced view of the situation by failing to mention any potential mitigating factors or alternative perspectives on Guyger's actions.

Overall, while the article presents a compelling narrative and emotional appeal, it also employs several propaganda techniques to reinforce its claims and create a particular narrative around Ted Cruz and law enforcement.
