I've analyzed the article and identified several propaganda techniques:

1. **Sensationalism**: The title of the article is designed to grab attention by mentioning a well-known figure (Linda Sarsour) and associating her with someone who has been involved in a violent crime (WTC bombing).
2. **Strawman Argument**: By linking Linda Sarsour to Siraj Ibn Wahhaj's alleged crimes, the author creates a negative perception of Sarsour without providing any evidence or context that she was directly involved.
3. **Ad Hominem Attack**: The article attacks Linda Sarsour by implying that her association with Siraj Ibn Wahhaj reflects poorly on her, rather than focusing on the actual facts and allegations against Wahhaj.
4. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "worst of the worst" and "filthy compound" are designed to create a negative emotional response in the reader without providing any factual context or evidence.
5. **Oversimplification**: The article presents Siraj Ibn Wahhaj as a straightforward villain, ignoring potential complexities or motivations behind his actions.
6. **Fear Mongering**: By mentioning school shootings and weapons training, the article aims to create fear and anxiety in the reader, which can be exploited for political gain.
7. **Red Herring**: The introduction of Linda Sarsour's name is a red herring designed to distract readers from the main topic (the allegations against Siraj Ibn Wahhaj) and create a false narrative.
