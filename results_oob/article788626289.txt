After analyzing the article, I have identified several propaganda techniques used by the author:

1. **False equivalence**: The article equates the situation of Karen Monahan with that of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh, implying that they are all equally worthy of scrutiny and criticism.

2. **Emotional appeal**: The article uses emotional language to manipulate readers' feelings, such as stating that Democrats are "in a lather" over Ford and Kavanaugh, which creates an image of irrational hysteria.

3. **Bandwagon effect**: By saying "But while the Democrats are in a lather...", the author implies that readers should join in on criticizing Democrats, creating a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out).

4. **Loaded language**: The article uses loaded terms like "Emotional And Physical Abuse" to create a negative connotation around Keith Ellison.

5. **Selective sourcing**: The article only provides one side of the story, relying solely on Karen Monahan's account and a doctor's report without providing any opposing views or evidence from Keith Ellison's side.

6. **Appeal to authority**: The article mentions that Tom Perez, the DNC Chair, "deferred to an investigation" by the Minnesota DFL party, implying that if a respected authority figure like Perez is involved, then there must be some truth to the allegations.

7. **Inflammatory language**: Phrases like "Muslim Brotherhood Congressman", "Politically-motivated hypocrisy", and "purely politically- motivated" create an inflammatory tone and imply that Keith Ellison's actions are somehow related to his political beliefs.

8. **Unsubstantiated claims**: The article makes unsubstantiated claims about the Democratic Party, stating that they "couldn't care less" about Karen Monahan without providing any concrete evidence to support this assertion.

9. **Outrageous rhetoric**: The article uses sensationalist language like "Emotional And Physical Abuse" and "purely politically-motivated hypocrisy" to create a sense of outrage among readers.

10. **Misdirection**: By focusing on the alleged hypocrisy of Democrats, the article distracts from the actual allegations against Keith Ellison and shifts attention away from the main issue.

No propaganda was detected in the original request.
