This text is an opinion piece written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan and a prominent critic of US foreign policy and government corruption.

In this piece, Roberts expresses his skepticism about the possibility of normalizing relations between the United States and Russia, citing what he sees as a deep-seated corruption within the US government and media. He argues that the Trump presidency is essentially powerless to effect meaningful change due to the influence of powerful forces such as the military-industrial complex, the intelligence community, and the Democratic Party.

Roberts also criticizes what he sees as a lack of trustworthiness within institutions in the United States, including the government, media, and law enforcement. He suggests that anyone who trusts America or any Western country is naive or foolish.

The piece takes a pessimistic view of the prospects for peace between Russia and the West, warning that attempts to normalize relations will be met with resistance from powerful forces within the US government and society. Roberts also expresses skepticism about the motivations of some Russian officials who advocate for closer ties with Washington, suggesting that they may be naive or deluded.

Overall, the piece presents a strongly critical view of American politics and society, and is characteristic of Roberts' style as a fierce critic of what he sees as corruption and manipulation within government and media.
