Here are the propaganda techniques identified:

* **Loaded Language**: "Demand" instead of "request" creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the importance of releasing the full report.
* **Emotional Appeal**: The phrase "without delay" creates a sense of anxiety and implies that any delay would be unacceptable.
* **Repetition**: The hashtag "#ReleaseTheReport" is repeated, emphasizing the demand for release and creating a sense of unity among Democrats.
* **False Dichotomy**: The statement "it would raise serious questions about whether the Department of Justice policy is being used as a pretext for a cover-up of misconduct" implies that not releasing the report would necessarily lead to a cover-up, presenting only two options instead of considering alternative scenarios.
* **Selective Reporting**: The article presents Giuliani's denial of the initial reporting as a response, but does not provide further context or clarification on the issue, potentially creating confusion and influencing readers' perceptions.
* **Sensationalism**: The headline "Dems in Congress Demand Barr Release Full Mueller Report ‘Without Delay’" uses strong language to grab attention, emphasizing the urgency and importance of the demand.
