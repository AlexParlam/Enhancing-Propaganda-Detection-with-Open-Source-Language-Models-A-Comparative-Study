Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Loaded language**: The article uses emotive language such as "cold-blooded killing", "threat to society", and "killer cop" to create a negative image of Amber Guyger.
* **False dichotomy**: The article presents a false choice between firing Guyger immediately and allowing her to continue working, without considering alternative solutions or a nuanced approach.
* **Appeal to emotion**: The article appeals to readers' emotions by highlighting the tragic circumstances of Botham Jean's death and the perceived injustice of Guyger remaining on the force.
* **Lack of balance**: The article presents only one side of the story, without providing any counterarguments or alternative perspectives. This creates a biased representation of the situation.
* **Misdirection**: The article shifts attention from the main issue (Guyger's continued employment) to unrelated topics (other police officers who were fired for similar reasons).
* **Unsubstantiated claims**: The article makes unsubstantiated claims about Guyger being "no longer fit for duty" and that she should be fired, without providing evidence or expert opinions to support these statements.
* **Misrepresentation of facts**: The article presents the Dallas Police Department's response as evasive or misleading, implying that they are intentionally hiding information or stonewalling the public.
