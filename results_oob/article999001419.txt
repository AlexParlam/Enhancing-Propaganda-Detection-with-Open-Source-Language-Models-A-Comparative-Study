Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article creates an emotional connection with readers by portraying President Trump's behavior towards Jim Acosta as "unbelievably rude" and "misbehaving". This evokes feelings of sympathy for Acosta and outrage towards Trump.
* **Loaded Language**: Words like "rude", "misbehaves", and "ignorantly blathered on" are used to portray Acosta in a negative light, while Trump's actions are portrayed as reasonable. The language is intentionally loaded to influence the reader's perception.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: The article creates a sense of urgency by stating that the court case isn't over yet and that "the legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon". This creates a sense of excitement and encourages readers to take sides.
* **Appeal to Conscience**: The article appeals to readers' moral compass by framing the issue as one of "First Amendment rights" and "freedom of the press". This evokes feelings of patriotism and concern for the future of journalism.
* **Scare Tactics**: The article suggests that if Acosta's hard pass is suspended again, it will be a threat to all journalists and news organizations. This creates fear and anxiety in readers, making them more likely to support CNN's position.

Note: These propaganda techniques are not necessarily malicious or intentional, but rather a result of the way the information is presented and framed.
