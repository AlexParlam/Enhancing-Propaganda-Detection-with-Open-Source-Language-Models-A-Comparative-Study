Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to emotion**: The author uses strong language to describe Jim Acosta and CNN, calling them "lying" and "immature children", which is meant to elicit an emotional response from the reader.
* **False equivalence**: The author claims that Fox News is not supporting a free press, but rather joining with CNN in a frivolous lawsuit. This creates a false impression of fairness and balance between two opposing viewpoints.
* **Loaded language**: The author uses loaded terms such as "least trusted name in news" and "Clown News Network" to describe CNN, which is meant to create a negative perception of the network in the reader's mind.
* **Ad hominem attacks**: The author makes personal attacks on Jim Acosta, calling him "rude" and "terrible", rather than focusing on the facts of the situation.
* **Straw man argument**: The author presents a simplified and exaggerated version of the situation, claiming that Fox News is supporting a frivolous lawsuit when in fact they are filing an amicus brief to support CNN's right to access the White House press corps.
* **Misdirection**: The author shifts the focus from the issue at hand (the revocation of Jim Acosta's press pass) to unrelated topics such as the supposed "immaturity" of CNN and Fox News' supposed lack of fairness and balance.

Note: These techniques are not necessarily unique to this article, but rather common in propagandistic writing.
