Here are the propaganda techniques identified:

1. **Appeal to emotions**: The article uses emotive language and examples (e.g., "accused serial woman abuser", "domestically abused") to create a strong emotional response in readers, which can influence their opinions and decisions.
2. **False equivalence**: The article implies that both the Star Tribune and Alpha News are equally motivated by a desire to uncover the truth, when in fact the two organizations have different political leanings (left-leaning vs. right-leaning).
3. **Loaded language**: Phrases like "corrupt party" and "lawless party" are used to create a negative connotation around the Democratic Party, which may be perceived as biased or unfair by some readers.
4. **Bandwagon effect**: The article references Barack Obama's 2004 Senate campaign to make a point about different rules for politicians, implying that if Obama did it, Keith Ellison should also face similar scrutiny.
5. **Appeal to authority**: The article quotes Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, as saying that the party's investigation will be finished soon and released to the public, which may give readers a sense of reassurance or confidence in the process.
