Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Appeal to Authority**: Bill Clinton portrays himself as a victim of media scrutiny, implying that he is a trustworthy authority figure who has been unfairly maligned.
2. **Bandwagon Effect**: By citing two-thirds of the American people siding with him 20 years ago, Clinton creates an illusion of widespread support and makes it seem like his actions were justified.
3. **Minimization**: Clinton downplays the significance of his affair with Lewinsky by implying that it was just a minor infidelity and not a "gross abuse of power" as Lewinsky has described it.
4. **Transfer**: Patterson, co-author of Clinton's book, tries to shift attention away from Clinton's own actions by comparing them to those of previous presidents (JFK and LBJ).
5. **False Dilemma**: Clinton presents his situation in a simplistic "either/or" framework: either he is guilty of something terrible or the media is unfair in their portrayal of him.
6. **Appeal to Emotion**: Clinton's language is emotive, emphasizing how he has been "vilified" and "financially ruined" due to the Lewinsky affair, which appeals to readers' sympathy.
7. **Red Herring**: By bringing up previous presidents (JFK and LBJ) who also had extramarital affairs, Patterson tries to distract from Clinton's own actions and imply that his behavior is not unusual or noteworthy.
8. **False Logic**: Clinton argues that he "dealt with" the Lewinsky affair 20 years ago, implying that it should be forgotten, even though Lewinsky has only recently spoken publicly about the trauma she experienced as a result of their encounter.

No propaganda techniques were detected in Lewinsky's statements, which primarily focus on her own experiences and emotions.
