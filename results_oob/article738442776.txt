After analyzing the article, I identified the following propaganda techniques:

* **Emotional appeal**: The use of phrases like "Yikes!" and "darkest chapters in American history" aims to evoke emotions such as shock, fear, or outrage in the reader.
* **Bandwagon effect**: By stating that even John McCain is worried about Trump's CIA pick, the article implies that the reader should also be concerned and join the majority in opposing Haspel's nomination.
* **Loaded language**: Terms like "state sponsored torture programs," "enhanced interrogation techniques," and "desperately misguided decision" are used to create a negative connotation and sway the reader's opinion against Haspel's involvement in the CIA's past activities.
* **Appeal to authority**: The article cites John McCain, a respected politician, as an example of someone who shares concerns about Haspel's nomination. This aims to increase credibility and trust with the reader.
* **Repetition**: The phrase "torture" is repeated several times throughout the article to emphasize its importance and create a sense of urgency.
* **Scare tactics**: By mentioning the consequences of squandering "precious moral authority," the article tries to instill fear in the reader about the potential repercussions of Haspel's nomination.
