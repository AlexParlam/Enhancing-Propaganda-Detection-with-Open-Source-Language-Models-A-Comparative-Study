This article discusses the recent purge of social media accounts, particularly those associated with conservative and libertarian voices, by Facebook and Twitter. The author argues that this action will lead to a loss of free thought and the spread of misinformation, as people are no longer exposed to alternative viewpoints.

The article quotes Ron Paul, former senator and libertarian voice, who says that "truth is treason" in an empire of lies. He notes that challenging the status quo is what they can't stand, and that silencing people is their preferred method.

The author highlights the massive influence of social media, with 2 trillion Google searches per day, billions of Facebook users, and hundreds of millions of Twitter users. They warn that this concentration of power will lead to a loss of free thought and the spread of misinformation, as people are no longer exposed to alternative viewpoints.

The article also discusses the dangers of social media's ties to the government, noting that private entities like Facebook have every right to remove accounts they wish, but when these actions are coordinated with government agencies, it raises First Amendment concerns.

The author emphasizes that even those who do not use social media personally will be affected by this purge, as the removal of alternative viewpoints will lead to a one-sided narrative on important issues like war, politics, and current events. They warn that people will believe what they're told because there is no alternative information presented, which is the textbook definition of brainwashing.

The article concludes by highlighting the need for people to take action, such as subscribing to newsletters, supporting alternative media financially, bookmarking websites, sharing articles on personal social media accounts, and joining alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe. The author notes that the truth is getting harder to find and that we must be vigilant in protecting our freedom of speech and thought.

Overall, this article argues that the purge of social media accounts is a threat to free thought and the spread of misinformation, and that people must take action to protect their right to access alternative viewpoints.
