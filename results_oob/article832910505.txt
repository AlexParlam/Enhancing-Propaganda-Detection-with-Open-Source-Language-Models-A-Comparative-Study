Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The use of sensational language, such as "Mueller Circus", "lies", "smears", and "assaults" to elicit emotions like anger and outrage.
* **Loaded Language**: Terms like "Obama/Clinton team", "Mueller coup members", and "swamp" are used to create a negative connotation towards the opposing political party.
* **False Dichotomy**: The article presents only two options: either Trump is investigated, or he gets to investigate and implement reforms. This creates an illusion of a zero-sum game where one side must lose for the other to win.
* **Appeal to Prejudice**: The author assumes that the reader shares their negative view of the opposing political party and will react with similar emotions.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: By stating "never underestimate the power of the swamp's spite", the article creates a sense of momentum around the narrative, implying that it is a popular and unstoppable force.
* **Appeal to Consequences**: The author warns that the investigations will have negative consequences for Trump and his supporters, implying that they should support him out of self-preservation.
* **Straw Man Argument**: The article presents the opposing political party as solely motivated by malice and spite, rather than considering alternative motivations or legitimate policy disagreements.
* **Red Herring**: The author's claim that the investigations are designed to punish Trump for being elected is a distracting and unfounded allegation meant to create outrage rather than promote constructive debate.
