Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to emotions**: The article uses emotional language to create a sympathetic response towards the defendants. For example, it describes the children living in "squalid conditions" and being prepared for "jihad and ... to die as martyrs".
* **False equivalence**: The author suggests that if the defendants were white Christians, no one would care about their activities. This implies that there is a double standard when it comes to religion and race.
* **Racial and religious bias**: The article implies that the prosecution's decision to charge the defendants with federal crimes was motivated by racial and religious prejudice against Muslims.
* **Bandwagon effect**: The author seems to be presenting the defendants' perspective as if it is the only reasonable one, implying that anyone who disagrees must be biased or uninformed.

Note: These techniques are not necessarily used intentionally to manipulate readers, but rather they can be seen as unintentional biases that shape the article's narrative.
