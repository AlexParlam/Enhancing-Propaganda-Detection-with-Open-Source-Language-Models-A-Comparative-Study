Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* Emotional Appeal: The article uses emotional language to create sympathy for the victims and outrage towards Keith Ellison. For example, it describes him as trying to "flee like a frightened puppy" when confronted about the allegations.
* Loaded Language: The article uses loaded language to create a negative perception of Keith Ellison and his supporters. For example, it describes them as trying to "block Loomer" and "cover up her camera", implying that they are trying to silence her.
* Misdirection: The article presents only one side of the story and does not provide context or allow for counterarguments. This can be seen as an attempt to misdirect the reader's attention away from the facts and towards a narrative that supports the author's conclusion.
* Bandwagon Effect: The article creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the importance of taking action against Keith Ellison. For example, it asks "Will the people not demand justice and vote a Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser into the office of prosecuting criminals?" This can be seen as an attempt to create a bandwagon effect, where readers feel pressure to join in on the perceived outrage.
* False Equivalence: The article implies that Keith Ellison's supporters are trying to silence Laura Loomer, but it does not provide evidence to support this claim. Additionally, it presents only one side of the story and does not allow for counterarguments or context.
