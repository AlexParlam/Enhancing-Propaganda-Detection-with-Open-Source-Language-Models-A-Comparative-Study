After analyzing the article, I have identified several propaganda techniques:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article uses emotive language to describe Jim Acosta's actions, calling him "argumentative" and saying he was "out of line." This aims to elicit an emotional response from readers, making them more likely to sympathize with CNN's side.
* **False Balance**: The article presents both sides of the story, but in a way that favors CNN's position. It quotes Sarah Sanders' statement about Acosta's behavior being "absolutely unacceptable," but also includes Kellyanne Conway's assertion that the video was simply "sped up" without providing further context or evidence to support this claim.
* **Loaded Language**: The article uses loaded language to describe Trump's actions, saying he was "making a sincere effort to answer Acosta's questions" when in fact the exchange was contentious and Acosta was not allowing Trump to finish speaking. Similarly, it describes the White House's actions as "violating CNN and Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press" without providing evidence or context.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: The article presents a poll asking readers whether Jim Acosta should have gotten his press pass back. This aims to create a sense of social pressure, making readers more likely to side with CNN's position if they don't want to be "left behind."
* **Appeal to Authority**: The article quotes an attorney for CNN and Acosta saying that the law is "clear" that the Trump administration violated their rights. This aims to establish credibility and authority, making readers more likely to accept the argument.
* **Repetition**: The article repeats the phrase "First Amendment rights of freedom of the press" multiple times to emphasize the importance of these rights and create a sense of urgency.

No propaganda techniques were detected in the original article.
