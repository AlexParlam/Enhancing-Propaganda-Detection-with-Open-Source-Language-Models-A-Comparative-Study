I have identified several propaganda techniques in this article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The article aims to elicit emotions such as fear, disgust, and outrage by presenting disturbing details about the alleged child abuse and brainwashing at the compound.
2. **Fear Mongering**: The article creates a sense of threat by implying that Muslims are secretly training children to carry out school shootings, thereby perpetuating negative stereotypes about Islam and Muslims.
3. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "Islamic compound," "brainwash and train," and "carry out mass shootings" are deliberately chosen to create a negative association with Islam and Muslims.
4. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: The article presents unverified claims about the existence of Islamic jihadi camps on American soil, which may or may not be true.
5. **Ad Hominem Attack**: The author's criticism of "Political correctness" is an ad hominem attack, targeting a perceived weakness rather than addressing the actual issues at hand.
6. **Appeal to Consequences**: The article appeals to readers' sense of morality and desire for safety by presenting the consequences of inaction or lack of vigilance against perceived threats from Muslims.

No propaganda techniques were detected in the initial report by Taos County Sheriff's Department, but the subsequent analysis and commentary by the author exhibit several propagandistic tactics.
