Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Scare tactics**: The article uses alarming language, such as "WIPEOUT Foreshadowed?", "terrible one", and "kill millions of people" to create a sense of fear and urgency.
2. **Appeal to emotions**: By highlighting the potential devastating impact on human life and the economy, the article aims to elicit an emotional response from readers, rather than presenting facts in a neutral manner.
3. **False dichotomy**: The article presents a simplistic "we're all going to die" scenario, implying that there is no alternative or solution to the impending disaster.
4. **Loaded language**: Phrases like "imminent global pandemic", "terrible toll", and "wipe out millions" are designed to create a sense of dread and emphasize the gravity of the situation.
5. **Quote mining**: The article quotes Dr. Tedros and other experts without providing context or clarifying their statements, which can be misleading or taken out of context.
6. **Misdirection**: By focusing on the potential pandemic as a global threat, the article may distract readers from other important issues or problems that are not highlighted in the article.
7. **Unsubstantiated claims**: The article makes unsubstantiated claims about the dangers of vaccines and the motivations behind them, without providing evidence or credible sources to support these assertions.

Note: These techniques are not necessarily used by all parties involved in the article (e.g., the World Health Organization), but rather appear to be employed by some individuals or organizations cited in the piece.
