Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* Emotional Appeal: The article uses emotional language to evoke feelings of outrage and sympathy for Botham Jean's family, such as "killing an innocent man" and "injustice".
* Loaded Language: Phrases like "special treatment", "egregious release", and "assassinate his character" are used to create a negative connotation about Amber Guyger's behavior.
* Confirmation Bias: The article presents the warrants' findings in a way that reinforces the narrative of police bias towards Amber Guyger, without providing alternative perspectives or presenting the full context.
* Cherry Picking: The article focuses on the fact that none of the search warrants involved the search of Guyger's apartment, while ignoring other details that might be relevant to understanding the investigation.
* Bandwagon Effect: The article uses collective action and public opinion to create a sense of moral urgency, stating "activists rallied around the Dallas Cowboy's stadium" and "the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice".
* Appeal to Authority: The article quotes an attorney, Stephen Le Brocq, to add credibility to its claims about the investigation.
* Scare Tactic: The article implies that Amber Guyger might still be a threat to residents in the apartment complex, stating "residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don't have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them".

Note that these techniques are not necessarily used maliciously or intentionally by the author. Propaganda often relies on subtle manipulation of information and emotional appeals rather than overt manipulation.
