After analyzing the article, I identified the following propaganda techniques:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The article uses emotional language to describe Abrams' actions, such as "gross mismanagement" and "deliberate and intentional" voter suppression. This appeals to readers' emotions and creates a negative impression of Brian Kemp.
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "suppression of the people's democratic right to vote" and "unconstitutional actions" are loaded with negative connotations, implying that Kemp's actions were illegal and harmful.
3. **Repetition**: The article repeats the idea that Abrams is fighting for fair elections and protecting voters' rights, emphasizing her commitment to justice and democracy.
4. **Personalization**: The article humanizes Abrams by quoting her campaign chair, Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, and describing her emotions ("These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed"). This makes readers more likely to empathize with her and support her cause.
5. **Bandwagon Effect**: By stating that Abrams has a team of "three dozen lawyers" working on the lawsuit, the article creates the impression that she is part of a large, powerful movement, making readers more likely to join the bandwagon.
6. **False Balance**: The article presents both sides' perspectives, including Kemp's statement about being ready to move forward, but gives more attention and credibility to Abrams' claims.

No propaganda techniques were detected in the quotes from Brian Kemp, which are presented as factual statements rather than emotive appeals.
