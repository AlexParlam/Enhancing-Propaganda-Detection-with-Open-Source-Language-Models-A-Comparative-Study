Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Appeal to Emotion**: The article uses emotive language to describe the events, such as "attempted to wipe out independent, liberty-minded, antiwar media" and "censorship... signals the beginning of the end of censored media". This appeals to the reader's emotional response rather than their rational thinking.
2. **Bandwagon Effect**: The article presents a narrative that suggests many people are being affected by the purge, saying "hundreds of thousands of people have lost their livelihoods" and implying that this is a massive issue. This encourages readers to join in and support the cause without critically evaluating the information.
3. **False Dichotomy**: The article presents a binary choice between two options: either you're with the independent media or against it. It doesn't consider alternative perspectives, such as the possibility that some people might not have a problem with corporate censorship.
4. **Loaded Language**: Words like "censorship", "silence", and "control" are used to create a negative connotation around the actions of social media platforms. These words carry emotional baggage and influence readers' perceptions without providing balanced information.
5. **Appeal to Consequences**: The article warns that if the reader doesn't support the cause, they might be silenced or censored themselves. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages people to take action without considering the potential consequences.
6. **Self-Promotion**: The article promotes the author's organization, The Free Thought Project, by mentioning its email list, subscriber base, and alternative platforms. This is not necessarily a problem, but it should be noted that the article has an inherent bias towards promoting this particular organization.
7. **Fear-Mongering**: The article creates a sense of fear around the idea of corporate censorship, suggesting that if people don't take action, they'll lose their voice and freedom. While some level of concern is warranted, the article's tone is alarmist and designed to elicit a strong emotional response.

It's essential to critically evaluate information, considering multiple perspectives and weighing the evidence before forming an opinion.
