Here is the list of propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. Emotional Appeal: The use of sensational language, such as "jihad training camp", "raise an army for jihad slaughter", and "killing non-believers on behalf of Allah" aims to evoke emotions like fear and outrage.

2. Scare Tactics: By highlighting the alleged "jihad" training, the article creates a sense of danger and threat, trying to scare readers into believing that Islamic extremism is a significant menace.

3. Demonization: The article portrays the defendants as evil and malicious, citing their alleged desire to train an army for jihad and perform supposed exorcism rituals on a three-year-old boy.

4. False Balance: By including quotes from defense lawyers claiming discrimination against the group because they are black and Muslim, the article presents both sides of the argument, but in a way that may be perceived as biased towards one side (the prosecution).

5. Red Herring: The inclusion of unrelated information about Nikki Haley's replacement as ambassador to the U.N. serves no purpose other than to distract readers from the main topic.

6. Loaded Language: Terms like "squalid", "dead body", and "cache of firearms" are used to create a negative image of the compound and its inhabitants, while descriptions of the defendants' actions are framed as "supposed exorcism rituals" rather than, for example, an attempt to heal a sick child.

7. Confirmation Bias: The article presents information that confirms readers' existing beliefs about Islamic extremism, without providing balanced or nuanced coverage.

8. Unsubstantiated Claims: Some of the claims made in the article are unsubstantiated, such as the alleged messages from God received by Jany Leveille or the supposed exorcism rituals performed on the three-year-old boy.

9. Cherry-Picking Evidence: The article focuses on the most sensational and alarming aspects of the case while omitting other details that might provide a more complete understanding of the situation.

10. Associating with Hate Figures: Pamela Geller, who posted the article with permission, has been associated with anti-Muslim sentiment in the past. This association may influence readers' perception of the article's credibility and tone.
