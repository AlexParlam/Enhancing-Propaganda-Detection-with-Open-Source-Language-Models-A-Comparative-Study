Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to emotions**: The article starts with a sensational headline ("Trump fires Tillerson...") to grab readers' attention.
* **Name-calling**: The author labels Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State as "State Department shenanigans" and describes it as "world-on-fire, Russians everywhere."
* **Loaded language**: Phrases like "big shake-up," "most important one to date," and "deep state" create a sense of drama and intrigue.
* **Stereotyping**: The author portrays Mike Pompeo as someone who is anti-Russian, using phrases like "believes Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs."
* **False equivalence**: By comparing Pompeo's views on Russia with Hillary Clinton's tenure, the article implies that both are equally problematic.
* **Fear-mongering**: The article mentions the threat of Russian aggression and the potential for increased U.S. involvement in Syria as a way to create anxiety.
* **Labeling**: The author describes Gina Haspel as "a big fan of torture" and links her to controversial CIA practices during the Bush era.
* **Oversimplification**: The article portrays Pompeo's foreign policy views as simply a continuation of Obama-era policies, without providing nuance or context.
* **Bandwagon effect**: By stating that George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren't going anywhere under Trump, the author is implying that readers should get on board with this trend.

Note: These propaganda techniques are not necessarily intentionally malicious but can still be effective in shaping readers' opinions and attitudes.
