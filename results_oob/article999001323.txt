Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article uses emotional language to create sympathy for Jim Acosta and CNN, such as "severe and unprecedented punishment" and "an unabashed attempt to censor the press". This aims to elicit an emotional response from readers, rather than just presenting facts.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: The article mentions that many news organizations support CNN's claim, implying that it is a widely accepted view. This encourages readers to join the majority and supports their initial opinion or bias.
* **Name-Calling**: The article quotes White House officials calling Jim Acosta's behavior "rude and aggressive", which can be seen as name-calling. This aims to discredit Acosta and create a negative impression of him in the reader's mind.
* **Glittering Generalities**: The article uses positive, glowing language to describe CNN and its supporters, such as "free, strong and independent American press". This creates a positive association with the organization in the reader's mind.
* **Transfer**: The article mentions that Fox News received support from rival news organizations during the Obama administration, implying that the same principles apply to this situation. This aims to transfer the perceived fairness of supporting Fox News to supporting CNN.
* **Card Stacking**: The article presents a one-sided view of the issue, focusing primarily on CNN's perspective and quoting supporters. It does not provide an equal representation of the White House's viewpoint, which can be seen as an attempt to manipulate readers' perceptions.
