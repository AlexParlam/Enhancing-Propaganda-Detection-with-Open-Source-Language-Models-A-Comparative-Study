This article, written by Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan, is a scathing critique of the Trump administration's handling of Russia relations and the political situation in Washington. Here are some key points:

1. Normalization of relations with Russia is not permitted: The author believes that normalization of relations between the US and Russia would be seen as a betrayal by many Americans, particularly those who believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
2. Trump's presidency is under attack: Roberts argues that President Trump has faced unprecedented opposition from the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the media since taking office.
3. Russiagate is a conspiracy against Trump: The author believes that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is a witch hunt designed to undermine Trump's presidency and that there is more evidence of a conspiracy against Trump than there is of actual Russian meddling.
4. The military/security complex is driving US policy: Roberts argues that the military/ security complex has significant influence over US foreign policy, particularly when it comes to Russia.
5. The media is complicit in the conspiracy: The author believes that the mainstream media is actively working to undermine Trump's presidency and is complicit in the conspiracy against him.

Overall, this article presents a dire warning about the consequences of not normalizing relations with Russia and the dangers of allowing the military/ security complex and the media to drive US policy.
