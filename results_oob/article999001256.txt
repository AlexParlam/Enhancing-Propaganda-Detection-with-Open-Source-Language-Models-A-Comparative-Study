Here are the propaganda techniques identified:

* **Straw man fallacy**: The article creates a false narrative by implying that Stacey Abrams is claiming widespread voter suppression and manipulation without providing evidence.
* **Ad hominem attack**: The author describes Abrams as a "sore loser" and compares her to Hillary Clinton, attempting to discredit her rather than engaging with her arguments.
* **False equivalence**: The article suggests that both parties are equally guilty of election irregularities, despite the lack of evidence supporting this claim.
* **Logical fallacy**: The author defines concession incorrectly, stating that it means acknowledging an action is right or proper. This misdefinition aims to undermine Abrams' decision not to concede.
* **Misrepresentation**: The article presents Abrams as trying to "find" and count votes, implying that she is attempting to manipulate the election results, without providing any evidence for this claim.
* **Lack of context**: The author fails to provide the necessary context about the voting issues in Georgia, instead relying on unfounded accusations and speculation.
* **Emotional appeal**: The article uses emotive language, such as "sore loser" and "temper tantrum," to elicit a negative emotional response from readers.
* **Loaded language**: Terms like "gross mismanagement" and "erosion of our democracy" are used to create a sense of urgency and crisis, rather than providing a balanced view.
* **Appeal to authority**: The author references the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as if it is an authoritative source, without presenting any opposing viewpoints or evidence.
