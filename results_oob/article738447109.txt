I've analyzed the article for propaganda techniques and identified the following:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The title "From Bad To Worse?" aims to evoke negative emotions in readers, creating a sense of foreboding.
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "What are you thinking?", "un-american comments", "Deep State in DC", and "tortured some folks" are designed to create a sense of outrage or concern.
3. **Misdirection**: The article focuses on the controversy surrounding Gina Haspel's appointment as CIA Director, while Pompeo's appointment as Secretary of State is mentioned briefly. This could be an attempt to distract readers from the more significant change.
4. **Citation of Unreliable Sources**: Edward Snowden's tweets are cited as evidence, but his credibility and motivations are not critically examined.
5. ** cherry-picking Information**: The article presents a one-sided view of Gina Haspel's past actions, focusing on her involvement in the CIA's torture program without providing context or counterarguments.

No other propaganda techniques were identified.
