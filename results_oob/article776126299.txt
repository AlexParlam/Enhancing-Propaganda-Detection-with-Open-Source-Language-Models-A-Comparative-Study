Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The use of strong emotions such as outrage ("Doesn't make much sense? Are you people serious?") and indignation ("Deadly serious") to sway readers' opinions.
2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "Communist ideology" and "barbaric fashion" are used to create a negative connotation towards the opposing view.
3. **Strawman Argument**: The author creates a false narrative by attributing an extreme position to those who support the judge's decision, implying that they want to keep "mothers hiring hitmen" or restricting access to information.
4. **False Dichotomy**: The article presents only two options: allowing 3D-printed gun plans or not allowing them. It doesn't consider alternative solutions or nuances in the debate.
5. **Misdirection**: The author shifts attention from the main issue (the judge's decision) to unrelated topics, such as the Second Amendment and the Tenth Amendment, to distract readers from the central argument.
6. **Appeal to Consequences**: The article emphasizes the "deadly serious" consequences of not allowing 3D-printed gun plans, implying that restricting access will lead to harm or chaos.
7. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: The author makes claims about the impact of allowing 3D-printed gun plans without providing concrete evidence or credible sources to support their assertions.
8. **Ad Hominem Attack**: The article attacks the character and qualifications of the judge and attorney generals, rather than addressing the substance of their arguments.

Please note that these techniques are not necessarily used maliciously; they may be unintentional or part of a larger narrative.
