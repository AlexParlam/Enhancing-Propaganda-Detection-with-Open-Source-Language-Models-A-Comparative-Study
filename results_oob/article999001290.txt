Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The use of emotive language, such as "badgering", "continual questioning", and "handling a White House aide" creates an emotional response in the reader, making them more likely to side with President Trump's decision.

2. **Simplification**: The author simplifies the issue by stating that the Fifth Amendment has no basis in this case, which is a subjective interpretation of the law. This oversimplification aims to sway readers who may not be familiar with constitutional law.

3. **False Dichotomy**: The article presents two options: "Yes, he should have gotten his press pass back" and "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass". This false dichotomy creates an illusion of only two possibilities, making it harder for readers to consider alternative perspectives.

4. **Bandwagon Effect**: By stating that "many many reporters in that room were unable to ask questions", the article implies that most people agree with President Trump's assessment, creating a bandwagon effect where readers are more likely to side with the majority.

5. **Appeal to Consequences**: The author warns about the potential consequences of not having rules and decorum at the White House press conferences, implying that chaos will ensue if President Trump does not take action.

6. **Appeal to Authority**: The article mentions Judge Timothy Kelly's ruling, framing it as an authoritative decision that supports President Trump's actions. This appeal to authority aims to establish credibility with readers who may be influenced by judicial opinions.

7. **Red Herring**: The author distracts from the main issue by introducing unrelated examples, such as Infowars' hypothetical demand for a White House press pass and President Trump's willingness to ignore Jim Acosta. These red herrings aim to divert attention away from the core argument.

8. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "strong, lying, propagandizing press" are designed to evoke a negative response in readers, making them more likely to support President Trump's decision.

9. **Misdirection**: The article focuses on Judge Kelly's ruling and the controversy surrounding Jim Acosta, while glossing over the underlying issues of media access and the White House's handling of the situation. This misdirection aims to distract readers from the core debate.

10. **Personal Attack**: The author makes personal attacks on Jim Acosta, describing him as "badgering" and claiming he was not truthful about his actions. This personal attack is meant to discredit Acosta in the eyes of readers.
