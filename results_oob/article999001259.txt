Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Loaded language**: The use of emotive and loaded words such as "the fix is in", "stole Arizona", and "one down three to go" creates a sense of conspiracy and bias.
* **Sensational headlines**: The title "Obama Judge Rules To Upend Georgia Election" uses sensational language to grab attention and create a sense of drama.
* **Personal attacks**: The inclusion of Jim Acosta's story in the article may be intended to distract from the main issue at hand and create a personal vendetta against him.
* **Selective presentation of facts**: The article presents only one side of the story, with quotes and statements from Abrams' campaign manager and Common Cause, but fails to provide an opposing view or quote from Kemp's campaign.
* **Emotional appeal**: The article appeals to emotions by highlighting the struggles of individual voters, such as the man who was "disturbed" to learn his registration history was erased.
* **Bandwagon effect**: The article creates a sense of urgency and momentum by stating that "every vote counts" and that Abrams is "fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count".
* **Appeal to authority**: The fact that Judge Amy Totenberg, an Obama appointee, made the ruling gives credibility to the article's narrative.
* **Misdirection**: The inclusion of statistics about provisional ballots and voter registration may be intended to distract from the main issue at hand.

Note: These techniques are not necessarily malicious or intentional, but they can contribute to creating a biased or sensationalized narrative.
