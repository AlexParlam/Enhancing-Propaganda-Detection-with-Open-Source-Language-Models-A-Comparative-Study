I identified several propaganda techniques in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The use of words like "Horrifying Details" and "Deadly NM Islamic Compound" aims to evoke emotions such as shock, outrage, and fear.
2. **Sensationalism**: The title and lead sentence are designed to grab attention with sensational information about a Muslim compound and child abuse.
3. **Leading Questions**: The article poses questions like "What is the first thing they do after it is discovered a child was murdered on the compound..." which implies that law enforcement officials acted inappropriately, without providing evidence or alternative explanations.
4. **False Balance**: The article claims that law enforcement did nothing about the Islamic compound despite tips and calls from concerned citizens, implying that there was intentional neglect. This creates a false dichotomy between "good" (concerned citizens) and "bad" (law enforcement).
5. **Loaded Language**: Terms like "Jihadi Muslims," "devout ('extremist') Muslims," and "sharia compliance" are used to create a negative connotation around Islam.
6. **Confirmation Bias**: The article presents its own poll on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which may be seen as an attempt to sway readers' opinions or reinforce existing biases.
7. **Association with Controversy**: By linking this news story to the topic of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, the article aims to associate Islam with controversy and divisiveness.
8. **Authoritarian Tilt**: The article presents a biased view by stating that law enforcement officials prioritized "making Islam look good" over investigating child abuse, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine trust in institutions.

Please note that these techniques do not necessarily mean the information presented is false, but rather that it may be presented in a way that reinforces specific beliefs or biases.
