Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The title "More UK Sharia: Firefighter Suspended For Supporting Tommy Robinson" uses sensational language to elicit an emotional response from readers, implying that the UK is descending into a state of Sharia law.

2. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "the Sharia is being implemented in the United Kingdom" and "the Muslims are ready to seek total control" use loaded language to create a negative association with Islam and Sharia law.

3. **Bandwagon Effect**: The article encourages readers to join a protest movement ("Free Tommy Robinson now!") by framing it as a righteous cause, implying that anyone who supports Tommy Robinson is part of the "good guys."

4. **Appeal to Conspiracies**: The article implies that there is a conspiracy against Tommy Robinson, citing his arrest and imprisonment without due process, and suggesting that this is part of a larger plot to silence him.

5. **Name-Calling**: The article labels the judge's decision to sentence Tommy Robinson within an hour as "tyranny," and implies that this is not just a one-time mistake, but rather a symptom of a broader problem with the UK's legal system.

6. **False Equivalence**: By comparing the UK's handling of Tommy Robinson's case to that of North Korea and Saudi Arabia, the article creates a false equivalence between these authoritarian regimes and the UK, implying that the UK is also becoming tyrannical.

7. **Glittering Generalities**: The article uses positive language to describe Tommy Robinson as a "hero" and his supporters as being part of a "righteous cause," appealing to readers' sense of morality and justice.

8. **Transfer**: By framing Tommy Robinson's imprisonment as a personal attack on him, the article transfers the reader's emotions from sympathy for Tommy Robinson to outrage against the authorities that arrested him.
