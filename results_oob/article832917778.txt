Here are the propaganda techniques identified:

**Emphasizing the negative**: The article focuses on the lack of new indictments as a result of Mueller's probe, framing it as a negative development.

**Selective presentation of information**: The article highlights that "several within Trump's orbit" were indicted, but does not provide specific numbers or details about the scope of the investigation. This selective presentation may create a biased impression about the extent of wrongdoing associated with Trump's inner circle.

**Omitting context**: The article does not mention the specific charges or allegations related to Trump himself or his family members. This omission could lead readers to assume that there was no wrongdoing or evidence of wrongdoings, without actually knowing the details.

**Playing on emotions**: By mentioning notable figures who have pleaded guilty, the article may elicit a emotional response from readers, such as surprise, shock, or anger, rather than presenting a balanced view of the investigation's outcome.
