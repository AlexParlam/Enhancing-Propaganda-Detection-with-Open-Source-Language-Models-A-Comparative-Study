Here are some propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Strawman argument**: The article presents a caricatured version of the military/industrial complex as a monolithic entity working to undermine President Trump and manipulate public opinion, without acknowledging any potential counterarguments or nuances.
* **False dichotomy**: The article implies that if Trump is removed from office, America will become a "complete dystopia" with all independent voices shut down, creating an oversimplified and binary view of the situation.
* **Appeal to emotion**: The article uses emotive language, such as "treasonous enemy of America," "sedition at the highest levels," and "complete dystopia," to create an emotional response in readers rather than relying on logical argumentation.
* **Ad hominem attacks**: The article makes personal attacks on politicians and media figures, labeling them as "assets" of the military/industrial complex, rather than addressing their policies or actions directly.
* **Appeal to authority**: The article cites Dwight Eisenhower's warning about the military/industrial complex as a way to lend credibility to its claims, without providing any additional context or evidence.
* **Loaded language**: The article uses pejorative terms like "presstitutes" to describe journalists and politicians who don't align with the author's views, creating a negative association in readers' minds.
* **Lack of nuance**: The article presents complex issues, such as US-Russia relations and the role of the military/industrial complex, in a simplistic and binary manner, without acknowledging potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives.
