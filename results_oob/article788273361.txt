Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Appeal to emotions**: The article uses emotional language to elicit sympathy for Karen Monahan's situation, such as "I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party" and "Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics? No, we & are families are trying to heal."
* **False equivalence**: The article implies that the Democratic Party is hypocritical for not believing Monahan's story while simultaneously supporting Christine Blasey Ford. This creates an unfair comparison between two different situations.
* **Playing on existing biases**: The article likely assumes that its readers have a negative view of the Democratic Party and are already skeptical of their actions. By framing the situation in this way, the article is exploiting these pre-existing biases to create a sense of validation.
* **Selective presentation of facts**: While the article presents some evidence supporting Monahan's claims (e.g., medical records and therapist statements), it does not provide an equal amount of information or context about Ellison's denials or the investigation that took place. This one-sided presentation creates an imbalance and potentially influences readers' perceptions.
* **Appeal to outrage**: The article uses sensational language, such as "Democrats don't believe my story" and "they do pick their 'victims' well, don't they?", to create a sense of indignation and outrage among readers.
