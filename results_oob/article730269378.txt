After analyzing the article, I identified several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to emotions**: The author appeals to readers' emotions by mentioning the domestic violence victim and the tragic event of a police shooting.
2. **Loaded language**: The use of phrases like "convicted felon" and "carried one everywhere" creates a negative connotation towards Quentin Lamar Smith, implying that he is a dangerous individual.
3. **Misdirection**: By focusing on Quentin's race and criminal history, the author attempts to divert attention away from the actual issue at hand (the police shooting) and create a narrative of blame-shifting.
4. **Confirmation bias**: The author assumes the domestic violence victim is white based on limited information (a wedding being held) and speculation about her accent in 911 calls, reinforcing their own biases.
5. **Appeal to authority**: The author mentions VDARE.com as the first news organization to report Quentin's race, implying that this source is trustworthy and authoritative.

No other propaganda techniques were identified in this article.
