Here are the identified propaganda techniques:

* **Emotional Appeal**: The article starts with a shocking revelation about Gina Haspel's involvement in torture and secret prisons, aiming to evoke emotions such as disgust or outrage.
* **Loaded Language**: The use of words like "worst abuses," "controversial interrogation program," and "harsh techniques" creates a negative connotation and emphasizes the severity of the issues.
* **Selective Facts**: The article presents a one-sided view by only highlighting Haspel's involvement in torture and secret prisons, omitting any potential mitigating circumstances or positive aspects of her career.
* **Repetition**: The repeated emphasis on Haspel's role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes and her central involvement in torture reinforces the negative narrative.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: By stating that a special prosecutor and grand jury investigated but chose not to prosecute, the article implies that there is no further accountability or consequence for Haspel's actions, potentially creating a sense of moral equivalence.
* **Source Credibility**: The use of reputable sources like The Washington Post and the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on torture adds credibility to the claims and creates an impression of authority.

Note: While these techniques are identified, it is essential to maintain objectivity and consider multiple perspectives when evaluating information.
