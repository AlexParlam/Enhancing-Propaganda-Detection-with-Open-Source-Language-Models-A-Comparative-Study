I analyzed the article for propaganda techniques and identified the following:

* Emotional Appeal: The article uses emotional language to describe the killing of Botham Jean, such as "outrage erupted" and "rightfully so", to elicit an emotional response from the reader.
* Loaded Language: Phrases like "admitted to walking into the apartment of 26- year-old Botham Jean and killing him" are loaded with negative connotations to emphasize the severity of Officer Guyger's actions.
* Bandwagon Effect: The article implies that most people agree with firing Officer Guyger by stating "outrage erupted" and "the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired", which creates a sense of consensus.
* Appeal to Conscience: The article appeals to the reader's conscience by emphasizing the moral implications of Officer Guyger's actions, such as "she walked into an innocent man's home and shot him dead" and "because of her actions, this man no longer lives".
* Use of Rhetorical Questions: The article uses rhetorical questions like "Apparently, it is no longer against the law" to create a sense of surprise or incredulity.
* Name-Calling: The article labels Officer Guyger's actions as "adverse conduct", which implies that her behavior was unacceptable and wrong.
* Glittering Generalities: Phrases like "justice for Botham since the beginning" are used to evoke positive emotions and create a sense of fairness.
