This article reveals that Keith Ellison, a prominent Minnesota politician and attorney, has a history of supporting cop killers and anti-police groups. Specifically, it highlights his involvement with Sharif Willis, the leader of the Vice Lords gang responsible for the 1992 execution-style murder of Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf.

The article also notes Ellison's support for other notorious figures, including Mumia Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop killer, and Assata Shakur (Joanne Chesimard), who is wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Shakur has been on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List since 2013.

Furthermore, the article criticizes Ellison's defense of Kathleen Soliah, a former member of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) who was responsible for the attempted murder of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. Soliah pleaded guilty to several crimes and is currently serving time in prison.

The author concludes that Ellison's actions demonstrate a pattern of support for anti-police groups and individuals involved in violent criminal activity, which raises questions about his fitness for public office, particularly if he seeks to become the top law enforcement official in Minnesota or run for statewide office.
