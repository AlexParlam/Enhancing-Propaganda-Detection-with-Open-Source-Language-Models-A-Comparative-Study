I have identified several propaganda techniques used in this article:

* **Emotional appeal**: The author uses emotional language to create a sense of outrage and sympathy for the victims, e.g., "two white Westerville, OH cops", " Officers gave their lives in defense of others", and "true American heroes".
* ** Loaded terminology**: The author uses terms like "Black Murders Of White Cops" and "Not Reporting Race" to create a sense of controversy and imply that the media is not reporting on race-related issues.
* **Selective presentation of information**: The article presents only one side of the story, focusing on the murder of two white police officers without providing context or background information on the suspect or the circumstances leading up to the incident.
* **Confirmation bias**: The author implies that if the victims were black and the perpetrator was white, the media would be reporting extensively on the race issue, implying that there is a double standard in reporting racial incidents.
* **Rhetorical questions**: The author poses rhetorical questions like "If these two men had survived, and Quentin Lamar Smith had died, you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue" to create a sense of indignation and imply that there is a conspiracy to suppress information on race-related issues.
