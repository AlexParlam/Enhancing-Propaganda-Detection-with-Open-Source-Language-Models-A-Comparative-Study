Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

* **Loaded language**: The use of emotive words and phrases such as "strained relationship", "big shake-up", "deep state", and "joyful glee" to create a sensationalized tone.
* **Confirmation bias**: The article presents Rand Paul's opposition to Trump's nominees without providing alternative perspectives or fact-checking his claims. This creates an impression that Paul's views are the only reasonable ones.
* **Emotional appeal**: The article appeals to readers' emotions by highlighting Paul's concerns about war and torture, creating a sense of unease and mistrust towards the Trump administration.
* **Bandwagon effect**: The article implies that opposing Trump's nominees is a popular stance among Republicans, citing John McCain's reservations as evidence. This encourages readers to join the opposition without critically evaluating the information.
* **Lack of context**: The article does not provide sufficient context about Rex Tillerson's tenure or Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel's qualifications for their new roles. This creates an impression that Trump's decisions are arbitrary and unwise.
