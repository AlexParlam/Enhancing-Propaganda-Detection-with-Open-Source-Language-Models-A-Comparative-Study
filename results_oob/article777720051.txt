Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The use of phrases such as "deplorable living conditions", "saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen", and "starving" is intended to evoke feelings of sympathy and outrage from readers.
2. **Repetition**: The repeated mention of the poor living conditions, starvation, and desperation at the compound is meant to drive home the gravity of the situation and emphasize the alleged wrongdoing of the Muslim extremists involved.
3. **Sensationalism**: The article uses sensational language and descriptions, such as "horrifying compound", "heavily armed men", and "starving" to grab attention and create a sense of alarm or shock.
4. **Loaded Language**: Terms like "Muslim extremist-run compound" and "extremist[s] of the Muslim belief" are used in a way that implies all Muslims are extreme or fanatical, perpetuating negative stereotypes about the religion.
5. **Omission**: The article does not provide context about the reasons behind the children's living conditions or the motivations of Siraj Wahhaj and Lucas Morten beyond labeling them as "extremists". This omission can create a misleading narrative that the authors are trying to convey.
6. **Fear-Mongering**: The inclusion of details like the presence of heavily armed men, loaded rifles, and pistols is meant to instill fear or anxiety in readers.
