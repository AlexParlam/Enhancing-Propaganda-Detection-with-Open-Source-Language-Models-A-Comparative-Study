Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the article:

1. **Emotional Appeal**: The use of phrases like "Make full Mueller report public", "The American people deserve to know the full truth", and "We will not allow Trump or his hand-picked attorney general to get away with obstructing this criminal investigation" aims to evoke emotions such as outrage, curiosity, and a sense of urgency.
2. **Bandwagon Effect**: The quotes from Democratic candidates like Cory Booker, Juli√°n Castro, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand all express strong support for releasing the Mueller report in its entirety, creating a sense of momentum and encouraging readers to join the "right" side of the issue.
3. **Appeal to Authority**: By citing Robert Mueller's report and Attorney General William Barr's statements, the article appeals to the authority of established institutions and respected figures to validate its claims.
4. **Scare Tactics**: The quote from MoveOn.org about staging protests if the report is "covered up" creates a sense of alarm and danger, implying that something sinister is at play.
5. **Loaded Language**: Phrases like "cover up", "obstructing this criminal investigation", and "Trump Is Not Above the Law" use loaded language to create a negative connotation around Barr's actions and imply wrongdoing.
6. **Repetition**: The repeated calls for releasing the Mueller report in its entirety, both from Democratic candidates and liberal activist groups, reinforces the message and creates a sense of urgency.

No propaganda techniques were detected in the article itself, but these techniques are present in the quotes and statements from Democratic candidates and liberal activist groups.
