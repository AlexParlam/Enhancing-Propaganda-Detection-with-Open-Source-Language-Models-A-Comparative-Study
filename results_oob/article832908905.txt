I've analyzed the article for propaganda techniques and identified the following:

* **Bandwagon effect**: The article quotes Trump's personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, saying they're "pleased" with the report being delivered to Attorney General Barr. This creates a sense of approval and reinforces the idea that everything is okay.
* **False balance**: The article presents both sides of the story by including quotes from Trump's personal lawyers, as well as criticism from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who cautions against jumping to conclusions based on only one side of the story. This creates a false sense of balance and neutrality.
* **Repetition**: The article repeatedly emphasizes that there will be no further indictments, which reinforces the idea that the investigation has concluded without finding any wrongdoing. This repetition can create a sense of finality and closure.
* **Source credibility**: The article quotes reputable sources such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, which adds credibility to their statements and opinions.

No other propaganda techniques were identified in the article.
