After analyzing the article, I have identified several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to emotions**: The author's emotional language, such as describing Judge Kelly's ruling as "surreal" and stating that the White House should be telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling, is designed to evoke feelings of frustration and outrage in the reader.

2. **Loaded language**: Terms like "ridiculous demand," "frivolous ruling," and "unconstitutional rulings from a federal judge who should know better" are used to create a negative perception of the opposing side's actions.

3. **False dichotomy**: The author presents two options: either the White House submits to Judge Kelly's ruling or they ignore it. This creates a false sense of urgency and oversimplifies the situation, making it seem like there is only one correct choice.

4. **Bandwagon effect**: The author asks readers to take a poll on whether Jim Acosta should have gotten his press pass back, creating a sense of community and encouraging readers to join in with a specific opinion.

5. **Appeal to emotions through storytelling**: The author shares personal anecdotes about how Jim Acosta treated others, including Sarah Sanders and President Trump, to create an emotional connection between the reader and the story.

6. **False or misleading information**: The author claims that Judge Kelly's ruling was "frivolous" without providing evidence or a detailed explanation of the ruling. This can lead readers to question the judge's motives and credibility.

7. **Divisive language**: The author uses phrases like "those who represent us" and "constitutionalists" to create an "us versus them" mentality, dividing people into opposing camps.

8. **Propagandistic tone**: The overall tone of the article is confrontational and accusatory, which can be seen as propaganda-like in its attempt to persuade readers to a specific point of view.

9. **Lack of nuance**: The author presents a simplistic view of the situation, omitting important details or perspectives that might complicate their argument.

10. **Calls to action**: The author provides guidance on how to deal with people like Acosta ("stop calling on them for questions") and encourages readers to take a specific stance ("make him regret it the entire time he is there"), creating a sense of empowerment and encouraging readers to act in a particular way.
