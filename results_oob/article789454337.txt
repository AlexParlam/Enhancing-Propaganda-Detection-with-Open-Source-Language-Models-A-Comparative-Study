After analyzing the article, I identified several propaganda techniques:

1. **Appeal to Emotion**: The article appeals to emotions by highlighting the perceived injustice and special treatment given to Amber Guyger, while juxtaposing it with the harsh treatment of protesters who peacefully protested her actions.

2. **Loaded Language**: The use of phrases like "blue privilege" and "rot in jail" creates a negative connotation towards law enforcement and implies systemic racism.

3. **Selective Presentation of Facts**: The article presents eyewitness testimony as contradicting Amber Guyger's initial statement, without providing the full context or alternative explanations for her actions.

4. **False Dichotomy**: The comparison between Amber Guyger's treatment and that of the protesters who were arrested creates a false dichotomy, implying that either the police are corrupt or the protesters are innocent, when in reality, both sides have their own motivations and actions.

5. **Appeal to Authority**: The article cites Attorney Lee Merritt as an authority on the matter, without presenting any contradictory views or facts from other sources.

6. **Bandwagon Effect**: The article's tone and language encourage readers to join a perceived movement against police brutality and racism, creating a sense of urgency and importance around the issue.

7. **Confirmation Bias**: The article presents information that confirms its narrative about police corruption and racism, while ignoring or downplaying any contradictory evidence.

8. **Misdirection**: The article focuses on the treatment of protesters who were arrested for obstructing traffic, rather than exploring other possible explanations for Amber Guyger's actions or the investigation process.

9. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: The article makes unsubstantiated claims about police corruption and racism without providing concrete evidence or credible sources to support these assertions.

Please note that this analysis is not intended to imply that the events described in the article are not true, but rather to highlight the use of propaganda techniques to shape readers' perceptions and emotions.
