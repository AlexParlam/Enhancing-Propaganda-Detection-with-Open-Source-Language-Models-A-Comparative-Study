Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: Uses specific phrases and words that carry strong emotional impact to affect the audience.
    - Example: "a menace to society"

2. Name Calling / Labeling: Assigns a label to the object of the propaganda campaign to incite either love or hate from the audience.
    - Example: "dangerous and reckless actions" (labeling Cody Wilson's actions)

3. Repetition: Repeats a message multiple times to ensure the audience accepts it.
    - Example: The article repeats the phrase "undetectable plastic weapons" several times.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: Either represents something excessively or downplays its importance.
    - Example: The article states that thousands of people downloaded the blueprints, but does not provide a specific number.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: Builds support by instilling anxiety or panic towards an alternative.
    - Example: The article quotes Kris Brown from the Brady Campaign saying "There is simply no way of telling how much damage has already been done..."

6. Flag-Waving: Utilizes strong national feelings (or respect to a group) to justify actions or ideas.
    - No example found in this article.

7. Causal Oversimplification: Assumes a single reason for an issue when multiple causes exist.
    - Example: The article states that the 1988 law made the current 3D-printed gun issue moot, but does not provide context about the law or its implications.

8. Appeal to Authority: Claims a statement is true because a valid authority or expert supports it.
    - Example: The article quotes Sarah Sanders from the White House and Kris Brown from the Brady Campaign.

9. Scare Tactics: Uses fear-mongering to influence the audience's perception of an issue.
    - Example: The article states that "the debate is over" and that "the guns are downloadable", implying that something catastrophic has already happened.

10. Red Herring: Introduces a diversion or a false argument to distract from the main issue.
    - No example found in this article.
