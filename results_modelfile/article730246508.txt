Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. **Loaded Language**: Uses specific phrases and words that carry strong emotional impact to affect readers' opinions. Examples: "true American heroes", "horrible shooting of two great police officers", "terrible tragedy for my hometown of Westerville and all of Ohio".

2. **Emotional Appeal**: Evokes emotions such as sadness, outrage, and sympathy to engage readers. Examples: descriptions of the fallen officers' families, quotes from their families, and reactions from law enforcement officials.

3. **Glorying in Sacrifice**: Portrays the fallen officers as heroes who gave their lives for a noble cause (serving and protecting the community). This can create a sense of reverence and admiration for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.

4. **Fear-Mongering**: Suggests that the attack on police officers is a threat to all Americans, implying that anyone could be targeted next. Examples: quotes from President Trump and Commissioner O'Neill expressing outrage and concern.

5. **Patriotic Appeal**: Uses patriotic language and imagery (e.g., flags at half-staff) to create a sense of national unity and shared grief.

6. **Divisive Language**: Implies that those who are upset about the attack on police officers are justified in their emotions, while others who might not share the same outrage are somehow less concerned or even complicit (e.g., "Everyone should be as upset about this as America's law enforcement officers are").

7. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: Makes claims without providing evidence to support them (e.g., the existence of fake GoFundMe pages and threats against police radio techs). This can create a sense of uncertainty and mistrust.

8. **Heroic Portrayal**: Presents the fallen officers as heroes who were dedicated to their jobs and families, emphasizing their selflessness and bravery.

9. **Emphasizing Tragedy**: Highlights the tragic nature of the event, using words like "horrible", "terrible", and "devastating" to create a sense of shock and outrage.

10. **Celebrity Endorsement**: Includes quotes from prominent figures (e.g., President Trump, Governor Kasich) to lend credibility and emotional weight to the story.
