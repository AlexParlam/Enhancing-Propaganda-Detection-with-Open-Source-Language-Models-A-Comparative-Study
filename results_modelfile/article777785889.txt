Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of phrases such as "filthy", "starving", and "heartbreaking" to create an emotional impact on the reader.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The labeling of the occupants of the compound as "Muslim extremists" and describing them as "heavily armed" to incite fear or dislike in the reader.

3. Repetition: The repetition of phrases such as "filthy", "starving", and "heartbreaking" to emphasize the conditions at the compound and create a strong emotional impact on the reader.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The description of the living conditions at the compound as "the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen" is an exaggeration, as it is not possible for one person to have seen all the worst living conditions in the world.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The labeling of the occupants as "Muslim extremists" and describing them as "heavily armed" is an attempt to appeal to fear or prejudice in the reader.

6. Flag-Waving: The emphasis on the fact that the FBI was involved in the investigation and the use of phrases such as "we all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had" is an attempt to create a sense of patriotism and national pride.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article implies that the poor living conditions at the compound are solely the result of the occupants' actions, without considering other possible factors such as poverty or lack of resources.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article cites Sheriff Hogrefe's statement about the conditions at the compound and his decision to execute a search warrant as evidence of the severity of the situation.

9. Slogans: The use of phrases such as "we are starving and need food and water" is an attempt to create a sense of urgency and sympathy for the occupants' plight.

10. Thought-Terminating Clichés: The description of the living conditions at the compound as "the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen" is a thought-terminating cliché, as it discourages critical thinking and useful discussion about the issue.

11. Emotional Appeal: The article uses emotional language to create a strong emotional impact on the reader, such as describing the children's clothing as "dirty rags" and their living conditions as "heartbreaking".

Note that some of these techniques may be used unintentionally or unconsciously by the author, rather than being a deliberate attempt to manipulate the reader.
