This article discusses the recent purge of alternative media outlets on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, which has resulted in a significant reduction in their reach and influence. The author argues that this is not just an attack on individual websites or personalities, but rather a coordinated effort to stifle dissenting voices and control the narrative.

The article highlights the impact of these suspensions on smaller alternative media outlets, which may not have the same level of resources or support as larger organizations like Infowars. The author notes that these smaller sites are often run by individuals who rely on their websites as a means of making a living, and that the loss of their online presence can be devastating.

The article also discusses the role of Google in this purge, citing leaked documents that suggest the company is actively working to censor certain types of content. The author argues that this is not just an issue for alternative media outlets, but rather a threat to free speech and thought more broadly.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of supporting alternative media outlets and promoting freedom of speech and thought. It encourages readers to subscribe to newsletters, support their favorite websites financially, and share their content on social media platforms. The author also suggests joining alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe as a way to promote free speech and resist the efforts of big tech companies to control the narrative.

Overall, this article presents a compelling case for why the purge of alternative media outlets is a serious threat to freedom of speech and thought, and why it is important for individuals to take action to support these outlets and promote their values.
