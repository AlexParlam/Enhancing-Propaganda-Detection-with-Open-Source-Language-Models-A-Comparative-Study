Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "lawless party" is used to create a negative emotional impact on the audience.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The term "corrupt party" is used to label the Democratic Party, inciting hate or dislike from the audience.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the phrase "the lawless party" and "the Democrat machine" multiple times to emphasize its point.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The statement "different rules for the lawless party" is an exaggeration, implying that the Democratic Party has a double standard.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article implies that if Keith Ellison's divorce records are not unsealed, it will be because of a conspiracy by the "lawless party".

6. Flag-Waving: The article uses strong national feelings (in this case, Minnesota) to justify its actions or ideas.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article assumes that Barack Obama's campaign unsealed Jack Ryan's divorce records as part of a broader conspiracy by the Democratic Party.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article cites an external investigator and Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, to support its claims.

9. Slogans: The headline "Star Tribune Sues To Unseal Accused Serial Woman Abuser Keith Ellison's Divorce Records" is a brief, striking phrase that includes labeling and stereotyping.

10. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The phrase "it is what it is" is used to discourage critical thought and useful discussion.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The article implies that the Star Tribune's motion to unseal Keith Ellison's divorce records is motivated by a desire to smear him, rather than a genuine interest in transparency.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options as the only possibilities: either Keith Ellison's divorce records are unsealed or there is a conspiracy by the "lawless party".

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The article implies that if Keith Ellison's divorce records are not unsealed, it will be because of a desire to protect him from scrutiny.

14. Doubt: The article questions the credibility of Karen Monahan and her allegations against Keith Ellison.

Note: Some of these techniques may be used multiple times in the article, but I have only listed each technique once.
