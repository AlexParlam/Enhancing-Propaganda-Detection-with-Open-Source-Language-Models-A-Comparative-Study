Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "Don Juan- like seductions" is used to describe Bill Clinton's actions, implying that they were somehow romantic or charming.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: Monica Lewinsky is referred to as the "former White House intern whose adult life has been defined by their inappropriate sexual affair and the global scrutiny that followed." This label implies that her entire life was ruined by the affair, rather than focusing on her achievements or personal growth.

3. Repetition: The article repeats Clinton's claims that he apologized publicly for his actions, implying that this is sufficient to absolve him of any wrongdoing.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: Clinton downplays the significance of his affair with Lewinsky, claiming it was "just a mistake" and that two-thirds of Americans sided with him. This minimizes the impact of the affair on Lewinsky's life and career.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article implies that Lewinsky is still traumatized by the aftermath of the affair, which may elicit sympathy from readers and make them more likely to support Clinton's claims.

6. Flag-Waving: The article mentions that Clinton is launching a book tour to promote his new novel, which may be seen as an attempt to boost his public image and distract from the controversy surrounding his past actions.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article implies that Lewinsky's trauma was caused solely by the affair itself, rather than considering other factors such as societal pressure or media scrutiny.

8. Red Herring: The article introduces irrelevant information about JFK and LBJ to deflect attention from Clinton's own actions and their impact on Lewinsky's life.

9. False Equivalence: The article presents Clinton's claims that he apologized publicly for his actions as equivalent to Lewinsky's experiences of trauma and humiliation, which is not a fair or accurate comparison.

10. Appeal to Authority: The article quotes James Patterson defending Clinton, implying that Patterson's endorsement carries weight and should be taken seriously by readers.
