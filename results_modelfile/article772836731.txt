A fascinating and thought-provoking monologue from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a former member of the US Senate staff and a renowned economist. He shares his insights on the current state of American politics, the military-industrial complex, and the challenges facing President Trump.

Roberts begins by recalling his experience working with Senator S.I. Hayakawa to promote supply-side economic policies during the 1970s stagflation crisis. He notes that the Democrats at the time were opposed to these policies, claiming they would worsen the budget deficit.

He then shifts his focus to the current political landscape, arguing that the military-industrial complex, neoconservatives, and Democratic Party are working together to discredit President Trump and prevent him from normalizing relations with Russia. Roberts believes that this effort is driven by a desire to maintain the status quo of American dominance and protect the massive budget of the military-industrial complex.

Roberts also touches on the topic of Russiagate, which he claims is a hoax designed to prevent President Trump from achieving peace between the US and Russia. He cites evidence from retired security professionals who have conclusively proven that Russiagate is a fabrication.

Throughout his monologue, Roberts emphasizes the importance of recognizing the corrupt nature of American institutions and the need for individuals to take action to protect their freedoms. He warns that if Putin and Lavrov do not recognize the true intentions of the West, they will be history.

Overall, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts' monologue provides a thought-provoking analysis of the current state of American politics and the challenges facing President Trump. His insights offer a unique perspective on the complex web of interests and motivations driving the political landscape.
