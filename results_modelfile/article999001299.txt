Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of phrases like "lying CNN", "least trusted name in news", and "Clown News Network" to create a negative emotional response towards CNN.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The labeling of Jim Acosta as a "rude, terrible person" and CNN as the "least trusted name in news".

3. Repetition: The repeated claims that CNN is lying and Fox News is supporting them, creating a sense of familiarity and reinforcing the negative image of CNN.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The claim that CNN has been lying for decades without providing evidence or specific examples, while minimizing the significance of the White House's revocation of Acosta's press pass.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The implication that Fox News is supporting a "rude, terrible person" and a "least trusted name in news", creating fear and prejudice towards CNN and its supporters.

6. False Dilemma: The presentation of only two options: either the White House has the right to revoke press passes or it's an attack on free speech, without considering other possibilities.

7. Ad Hominem Attack: The personal attacks on Jim Acosta and Bob Woodward, rather than addressing their arguments or evidence.

8. Misdirection: The focus on CNN's supposed lying and Fox News' support for them, while diverting attention from the actual issue of the White House's revocation of Acosta's press pass.

9. Red Herring: The introduction of unrelated topics, such as the idea that a free press is not possible without a press pass to the White House, in order to distract from the main issue.

10. Strawman Argument: The presentation of an exaggerated or distorted version of the opposing viewpoint (in this case, the idea that CNN's lawsuit is frivolous) and then attacking it, rather than addressing the actual arguments made by the opposing side.
