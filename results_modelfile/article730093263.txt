Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of phrases like "true American heroes" to evoke strong emotional impact.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The categorization of the article into "Black Murders Of White Cops" and "Not Reporting Race", which aims to incite emotions and create a specific narrative.

3. Repetition: The repeated mention of the race issue, with phrases like "he is black" and "except for the photograph, there's no mention of the race issue", which aims to reinforce the message and make it more memorable.

4. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The implication that if the officers had survived and Quentin Lamar Smith had died, the media would be highlighting the race issue, which aims to build support by instilling anxiety or panic towards an alternative.

5. Flag-Waving: The use of phrases like "true American heroes" and "American" to evoke strong national feelings and justify actions or ideas.

6. Thought-Terminating Clichés: The phrase "If these two men had survived, and Quentin Lamar Smith had died..." is a thought-terminating cliché that discourages critical thought and useful discussion.

7. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The implication that the media would be highlighting the race issue if the officers had survived and Quentin Lamar Smith had died is a whataboutist argument that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly disproving their argument.

8. Black-and-White Fallacy: The presentation of two alternative options as the only possibilities, ignoring other options, such as the possibility that the media would not be highlighting the race issue regardless of the outcome.
