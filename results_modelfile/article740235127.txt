Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "whatever it takes" has a strong emotional impact and implies that Rand Paul will stop at nothing to block the confirmations.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The author labels Pompeo as an "advocate for regime change, really everywhere", which is meant to evoke negative emotions towards him.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the idea that torture is unacceptable and that Senator Paul is standing up against it, emphasizing his stance.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The author minimizes the effectiveness of torturing jihadis in stopping terror attacks by saying they haven't seen "real hard evidence" to support this claim.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article appeals to fear by warning about the dangers of regime change and the potential consequences of allowing Pompeo and Haspel to lead their respective agencies.

6. Flag-Waving: The author uses patriotic language, such as "We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful", to justify Senator Paul's stance against torture.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article oversimplifies the causes of regime change and its consequences, implying that it is always bad and never effective.

8. Appeal to Authority: The author cites a former journalist who claimed that the media lies for the CIA as evidence to question the credibility of media reports on the effectiveness of torture.

9. Slogans: The article uses slogans like "Make America great again!" (although not directly quoted) to evoke strong emotions and create a sense of urgency.

10. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The phrase "I don't think our policy ought to be for regime change" is meant to discourage critical thought and useful discussion on the topic.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The author presents Senator Paul's stance against torture as a warning about what could happen if Pompeo and Haspel are confirmed, rather than directly addressing their qualifications or policies.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options - allowing regime change to occur or standing up against it - without considering other possibilities.

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The author implies that people who support Pompeo and Haspel are acting out of emotion and fear, rather than critically evaluating the situation.

14. Doubt: The article questions the credibility of media reports on the effectiveness of torture by citing a former journalist's claim that the media lies for the CIA.

Note that some of these techniques may be used subtly or indirectly, but they can still have an impact on the reader's perception and understanding of the issue.
