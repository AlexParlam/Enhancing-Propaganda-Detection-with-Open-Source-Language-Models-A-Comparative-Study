Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: Uses phrases like "Mueller circus", "lies, smears and assaults", "Roman circus" to create a negative emotional impact on the audience.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: Labels Robert Mueller as having an "inevitable grim face" and the Obama/Clinton team behind him as being involved in "smears and assaults".

3. Repetition: Repeats the phrase "the swamp" multiple times to emphasize its supposed negative nature and create a sense of unity among those who oppose it.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: Downplays the significance of the Mueller report by calling it "inevitable lies, smears and assaults", implying that it is inherently flawed.
