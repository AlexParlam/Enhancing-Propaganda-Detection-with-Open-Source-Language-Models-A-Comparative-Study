Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "glad it's over" used by President Trump is an example of loaded language, as it implies a sense of relief or satisfaction.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The term "collusion narrative" is used to label a particular idea or theory, which can be seen as an attempt to discredit it and create a negative connotation.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the phrase "must be provided to Congress immediately" several times, emphasizing the importance of releasing the report and creating a sense of urgency.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The statement that "nothing short of [releasing the report] will suffice" is an example of exaggeration, as it implies that any alternative solution would not be sufficient.

5. Appeal to Authority: The article quotes several authorities, including Sen. Mark Warner and Sen. Chuck Grassley, to support their claims and create a sense of credibility.

6. Flag-Waving: The phrase "put an end to the speculation and innuendo" is an example of flag-waving, as it appeals to national feelings (in this case, the desire for truth and transparency).

7. Causal Oversimplification: The statement that "we still haven't seen any evidence of collusion" oversimplifies the issue by implying that there was no collusion at all, without considering other possible explanations.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article quotes Attorney General William Barr as saying that he will review the report and provide his own report on Mueller's findings, which can be seen as an attempt to establish credibility and trust in his judgment.

9. Slogans: The phrase "make the full report public" is a slogan that summarizes the demands of several top Democrat lawmakers, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose.

10. Thought-Terminating Clichés: The phrase "it's imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public" uses a thought-terminating cliché ("imperative") to discourage critical thinking and encourage a sense of urgency.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The statement that "attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse" is an example of whataboutism, as it attempts to discredit alternative viewpoints without directly addressing them.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternatives - releasing the report and creating a sense of transparency, or keeping it secret and perpetuating speculation - without considering other possible solutions.

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The statement that "Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller's reputation for integrity and thoroughness" is an example of bandwagoning, as it implies that everyone else agrees with this assessment, making it seem like a popular or mainstream view.

14. Doubt: The article raises doubts about the credibility of the report by stating that some lawmakers are demanding its immediate public release, implying that there may be something to hide or that the report is not trustworthy.
