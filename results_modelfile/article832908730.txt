Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "total witch hunt" used by President Trump to describe the investigation is an example of loaded language.

2. Repetition: The article repeats the fact that Mueller's report has been submitted and the Justice Department's response several times, emphasizing its significance.

3. Appeal to Authority: The article quotes Attorney General William Barr as saying he will consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about releasing information from the report, appealing to the audience's trust in these authorities.

4. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two options for releasing the report: a summary without classified information or a full report, implying that there are only these two possibilities.

5. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The article mentions that President Trump has previously said he supports making the report public and quotes him as saying "I don't mind" and "If you want, let them see it." This is an attempt to make the audience feel like they should be on the same side as Trump.

6. Appeal to Emotion: The article uses phrases such as "transfixed the nation," "brought down a handful of Trump's closest advisers," and "the end of an investigation that has for nearly two years transfixed the nation" to create emotional resonance with the audience.

7. Red Herring: The article mentions that several witnesses have been questioned about other countries' efforts to meddle in American politics, which is not directly related to the main topic of Mueller's report. This is an attempt to distract from the real issue and create a sense of complexity.

8. Appeal to Consequences: The article emphasizes the significance of the investigation by mentioning its scope, the number of indictments and convictions, and the impact on Trump's associates.
