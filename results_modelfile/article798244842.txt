The article discusses the censorship of independent media outlets by social media platforms and the government, particularly in the context of the 2020 election. The author argues that this censorship is a response to the growing awareness and consciousness among people about political corruption, elite pedophilia, and ritual abuse.

The article suggests that the Deep State, which includes powerful corporations and financial elites, is trying to silence independent media outlets because they are threatening their power and control over society. The author notes that even if social media platforms delete more independent media sites, they cannot erase them from the internet entirely.

The article also highlights the fact that people are still going to search for information and alternative forms of information, given the fact that what they see coming from mainstream sources is often highly suspect and questionable. The author suggests that this shift in consciousness is unstoppable and will continue to grow, regardless of attempts to censor it.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing what's happening with censorship and the ridicule or finger pointing of people who voice opposition to mainstream rhetoric. It also notes that independent media represents a shift in consciousness and that change will continue to happen, even if the deep state tries to silence it.
