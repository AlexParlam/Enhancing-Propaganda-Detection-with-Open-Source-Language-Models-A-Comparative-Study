Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "thanks to his antics and confrontations" is used to portray Jim Acosta's behavior in a negative light.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The term "misbehavior" is used to label Jim Acosta's actions, implying that they are unacceptable.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the idea that Jim Acosta's pass was restored due to his misbehavior and that he will have to abide by new rules of conduct.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The article minimizes the implications of the new rules, framing them as a minor concession rather than a significant change in the way the White House interacts with journalists.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article implies that the new rules will disproportionately affect journalists who are critical of Trump, suggesting that they may face retaliation or censorship for their reporting.

6. Flag-Waving: The article frames the restoration of Jim Acosta's pass as a victory for freedom of the press and the First Amendment, without providing context about the implications of the new rules.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article oversimplifies the reasons why the White House created new rules, implying that they were solely in response to Jim Acosta's behavior rather than a broader effort to control the narrative around Trump.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article cites a federal judge's order as evidence that the White House was forced to restore Jim Acosta's pass, without providing context about the legal issues at play.

9. Slogans: The headline "White House backs down from legal fight" is a slogan that frames the story in a way that is likely to resonate with readers who are sympathetic to CNN and critical of Trump.

10. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The phrase "backing down" is used to describe the White House's decision, implying that they were forced to retreat rather than making a deliberate choice.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The article implies that the new rules will disproportionately affect journalists who are critical of Trump, without providing evidence or context about how this might be the case.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents the restoration of Jim Acosta's pass as a binary choice between freedom of the press and censorship, without acknowledging the complexities of the issue.

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The article implies that the mainstream media is celebrating the White House's decision to restore Jim Acosta's pass because it is a victory for freedom of the press, rather than presenting a nuanced analysis of the issue.

14. Loaded Language: The phrase "backing down" is used again to describe the White House's decision, implying that they were forced to retreat rather than making a deliberate choice.
