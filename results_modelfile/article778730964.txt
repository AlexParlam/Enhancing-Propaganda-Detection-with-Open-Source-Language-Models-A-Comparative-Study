Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "filthy, makeshift compound" is used to create a negative emotional impact on the audience.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The term "anti-Muslim propaganda" is used to label the raid as an attack on Muslims, inciting hate or sympathy from the audience.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the phrase "anti-Muslim propaganda" multiple times to emphasize its point and create a sense of urgency.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The article minimizes the severity of the situation by calling it a "domestic situation" and downplaying the extent of the extremism involved.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article appeals to fear by implying that the raid is an attack on Muslims, which may incite anxiety or panic in some readers.

6. Flag-Waving: The article uses strong national feelings (in this case, anti-Muslim sentiment) to justify its point and create a sense of patriotism.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article oversimplifies the situation by attributing it solely to "anti-Muslim propaganda" without considering other possible causes or complexities.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article cites Robert Spencer as an authority on the topic, implying that his opinion is credible and trustworthy.

9. Slogans: The headline "The Latest: Compound incident called anti-Muslim propaganda" uses a brief, striking phrase to label the event and create a sense of urgency.

10. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The article uses phrases like "war is deceit" and "ever the victim" to discourage critical thought and useful discussion.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The article questions the credibility of authorities by implying that they are making false claims without evidence, rather than directly addressing the issue at hand.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options (the raid is either "anti-Muslim propaganda" or a legitimate law enforcement action) as the only possibilities, ignoring other possible explanations.

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The article implies that anyone who disagrees with its point is part of a larger conspiracy to attack Muslims, rather than engaging in a constructive discussion.

14. Doubt: The article casts doubt on the contention by prosecutors that children were being trained for school shootings, without providing evidence or alternative explanations.

Note: Some techniques may be used multiple times throughout the article, but I have only listed each technique once.
