Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: Uses specific phrases and words that carry strong emotional impact to affect the audience.
    - Example: "a surreal, frivolous ruling"
2. Name Calling / Labeling: Assigns a label to the object of the propaganda campaign to incite either love or hate from the audience.
    - Example: "constitutionalist", "ridiculous demand", "unprofessional behavior"
3. Repetition: Repeats a message multiple times to ensure the audience accepts it.
    - Example: "We would have greatly preferred...", "But, given the position taken by CNN..."
4. Exaggeration / Minimization: Either represents something excessively or downplays its importance.
    - Example: "This is my advice to the White House... Don't call on Jim Acosta another time for as long as he remains in the White House Press."
5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: Builds support by instilling anxiety or panic towards an alternative.
    - Example: "I can see this going way downhill"
