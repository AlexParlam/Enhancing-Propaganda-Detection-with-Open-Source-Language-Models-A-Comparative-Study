Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of words like "horrifying", "deadly", "devout", and "jihadi" to create a negative emotional impact on the reader.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The labeling of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his wife as "devout" ("extremist") Muslims, which is meant to evoke a negative reaction from the audience.

3. Repetition: The repetition of the phrase "new charges were filed" emphasizes the importance of the new developments in the case.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The statement "For years, the FBI and local law enforcement did nothing about this jihad compound" is an exaggeration, as it implies that they completely ignored the situation, when in reality they may have been investigating or monitoring the compound without taking action.

5. Appeal to Fear: The article appeals to fear by highlighting the danger posed by the Islamic compound and the harm caused to children.

6. Flag-Waving: The article uses patriotism and national pride by implying that law enforcement officials are prioritizing making Islam look good, which is meant to evoke a sense of loyalty and support for American values.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The statement "It took the murder of a child to get them to pay attention" oversimplifies the situation by implying that the only reason law enforcement took action was because of the murder, when in reality there may have been other factors at play.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article cites Pamela Geller as the author, which lends credibility to her views and implies that she is an authority on the topic.

9. Slogans: The headline "Horrifying Details Released" is a slogan meant to grab attention and create a sense of urgency.

10. Thought-Terminating Clichés: The phrase "It's sharia compliance in New Mexico" is a thought-terminating cliché that discourages critical thinking and encourages readers to accept the idea without questioning it.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The article presents a straw man argument by implying that law enforcement officials are prioritizing making Islam look good, when in reality they may be taking action for other reasons.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents the situation as either "law enforcement did nothing" or "they destroyed evidence", without acknowledging any possible middle ground or nuance.

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The article implies that law enforcement officials are prioritizing making Islam look good, which is meant to evoke a sense of outrage and support for the author's views.

14. Doubt: The article questions the credibility of law enforcement officials by implying that they are prioritizing making Islam look good, rather than taking action based on evidence or facts.

Note: Some of these techniques may be used multiple times in the article, but I have only listed each technique once.
