Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "cover up Mueller's report" is used to create a negative emotional impact on the audience.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The term "hand-picked attorney general" is used to label William Barr in a negative light, implying that he was chosen for his loyalty rather than his qualifications.

3. Repetition: The phrase "release the Mueller report" is repeated multiple times by different Democratic candidates, emphasizing their demand and creating a sense of urgency.

4. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The statement from MoveOn.org mentions "rapid-response protests around the country" in response to Barr's potential decision to cover up the report, which may create fear or anxiety among readers who support the protesters' cause.

5. Flag-Waving: The article quotes Democratic candidates demanding that the Mueller report be made public, using patriotic language like "the American people deserve to know" and "the American public has a right to know".

6. Appeal to Authority: The article cites Attorney General Barr's testimony during his confirmation hearings, where he promised to provide transparency regarding the Mueller report.

7. Slogans: The tweets from Democratic candidates use short, striking phrases like "Make full Mueller report public" and "Release the Mueller report", which can be seen as slogans that aim to rally support for their cause.

8. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The phrase "Trump Is Not Above the Law" is used by MoveOn.org, which may discourage critical thought and useful discussion about the issue at hand.

9. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The article implies that Barr's decision to release a summary of the report rather than the full report is an attempt to "cover up" the findings, without directly disproving his reasoning or providing alternative explanations.

10. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two options as the only possibilities: releasing the full report or covering it up, without considering other alternatives like redacting sensitive information or providing a summary with key findings.
