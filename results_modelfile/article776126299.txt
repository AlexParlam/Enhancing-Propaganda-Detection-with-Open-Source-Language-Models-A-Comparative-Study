The eight states - Washington, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania - along with the District of Columbia, have sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for 3D firearms.

The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday. The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.

In the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans. Trump said Tuesday that he's "looking into" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public "doesn't seem to make much sense!"

The lawsuit argues that the settlement is in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms. Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals, which will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.

Defense Distributed's lawyer, Josh Blackman, said that "The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement. This latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration."

As reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them.

While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files - which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do - the distribution is already happening.
