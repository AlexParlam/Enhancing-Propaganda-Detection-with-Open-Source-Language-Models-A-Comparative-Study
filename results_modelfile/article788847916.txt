Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: Uses specific phrases and words that carry strong emotional impact to affect the audience.
	* Example: "cold-blooded killing", "innocent man", "pillar of society"

2. Name Calling / Labeling: Assigns a label to the object of the propaganda campaign to incite either love or hate from the audience.
	* Example: "killer cop", "cop who killed an innocent man"

3. Repetition: Repeats a message multiple times to ensure the audience accepts it.
	* Example: The article repeats the phrase "why hasn't the chief fired Guyger" several times.

4. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: Builds support by instilling anxiety or panic towards an alternative.
	* Example: The article implies that if Amber Guyger is not fired, she will continue to be a threat to society.

5. Flag-Waving: Utilizes strong national feelings (or respect to a group) to justify actions or ideas.
	* No example found in this article.

6. Causal Oversimplification: Assumes a single reason for an issue when multiple causes exist.
	* Example: The article implies that Amber Guyger's job should be taken away solely because she killed someone, without considering other factors that might be relevant.

7. Appeal to Authority: Claims a statement is true because a valid authority or expert supports it.
	* Example: The article cites experts like Justin Moore and WFAA as supporting the claim that Chief Hall can fire Amber Guyger.

8. Slogans: Brief, striking phrases that include labeling and stereotyping.
	* Example: "killer cop", "cop who killed an innocent man"

9. Emotional Appeal: Uses emotional appeals to sway the audience's opinion.
	* Example: The article uses emotional language like "cold-blooded killing" and "innocent man" to elicit emotions from the reader.

10. False Dilemma: Presents only two options as if they are the only possibilities, when in reality there may be other options.
	* Example: The article presents the option of firing Amber Guyger as the only reasonable solution, without considering other possible solutions or consequences.
