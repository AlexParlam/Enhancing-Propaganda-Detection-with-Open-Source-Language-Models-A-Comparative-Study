Laura Loomer confronted Keith Ellison about numerous domestic violence allegations brought against him by two different women, Amy Alexander and Karen Monahan. Loomer questioned Ellison about a 2005 police report filed by Alexander, who had a relationship with him at the time.

The police report stated that there was a domestic violence call to Alexander's house, despite Ellison denying the allegations. Loomer asked why the police were called, but Ellison failed to provide his side of the story.

Alexander is not the only woman to make abuse accusations against Ellison. Karen Monahan accused him of being physically and verbally abusive towards her in 2016. Ellison has denied both sets of allegations.

The situation highlights the hypocrisy of Democrats who often rush to judgment when their political opponents are accused of similar behavior, but remain silent or defensive when one of their own is accused.
