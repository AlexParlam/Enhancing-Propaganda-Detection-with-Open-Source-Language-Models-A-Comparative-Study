Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "outrage across the nation" is used to create an emotional impact and sway public opinion.

2. Repetition: The article repeats the fact that Guyger entered the wrong apartment, killed Jean, and was arrested multiple times to emphasize the severity of the situation.

3. Appeal to Emotion: The article appeals to emotions by describing the victim's death as "devastating" and mentioning that next-of-kin notification has not been made at this time, which creates a sense of tragedy.

4. Misdirection: The author questions whether Guyger leaves her door unlocked, which distracts from the main issue and shifts attention away from the police department's handling of the situation.

5. False Equivalence: The article implies that if someone else had done the same thing as Guyger, they would have been taken into custody immediately, which is not necessarily true and creates a false sense of equivalence.

6. Unsubstantiated Claims: The author states that "any of us who did the same thing" would have been taken into custody without providing evidence or examples to support this claim.

7. Emotive Language: The article uses emotive language such as "devastated" and "outrage" to create a strong emotional response in readers.

8. Unfair Comparison: The author compares Guyger's actions to those of an average person, implying that she should have been treated differently because she is a police officer, which is an unfair comparison.

9. Lack of Context: The article does not provide sufficient context about the investigation and the circumstances surrounding Jean's death, which could be used to sway public opinion.

10. Unsubstantiated Claims (again): The author states that "we all know" that certain things would have happened if someone else had done the same thing as Guyger, without providing evidence or examples to support these claims.
