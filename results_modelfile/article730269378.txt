Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of phrases like "Thanks for publicizing" and "great work" creates a positive emotional impact on the audience.
2. Name Calling / Labeling: The label "convicted felon" is assigned to Quentin Lamar Smith, which may incite negative emotions towards him.
3. Repetition: The emphasis on VDARE.com being the first to release information about Quentin's race ("VDARE.com was the first news organization...") reinforces their credibility and importance.
