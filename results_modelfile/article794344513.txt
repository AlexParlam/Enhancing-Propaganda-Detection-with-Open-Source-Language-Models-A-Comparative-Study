The poem does not end, it appears to be a tweet by Anya Parampil, and the link provided is not a poem but rather an article about Facebook's purge of independent media pages.

The article discusses how Facebook removed over 500 pages and accounts that were deemed to be spreading misinformation or engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior. However, many of these pages, including The Free Thought Project, argue that they were targeted because they challenged the status quo and reported on information that the mainstream media tends to ignore.

The article highlights the close ties between Facebook and the US government, with Facebook partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank. This has led some to question whether Facebook's actions are motivated by a desire to suppress alternative voices and promote a particular narrative.

The article concludes by noting that while this purge may seem like a blow to independent media, it also serves as a wake-up call for those who value free speech and the ability to access information without censorship.
