Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: "The fix is in." This phrase carries strong emotional impact and implies that the election was rigged.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: "They stole Arizona." This statement labels the outcome of another state's election as stolen, which may incite emotions and create a negative perception of the opposing party.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the idea that Abrams' campaign is fighting for every vote to count, emphasizing her refusal to concede until all votes are counted.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The article minimizes Kemp's lead by stating it's "mathematically impossible" for Abrams to force a runoff, while also exaggerating the importance of provisional ballots in potentially swaying the election.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article implies that if provisional ballots are not counted, voters may be disenfranchised and their voices silenced, which can create fear and anxiety among readers.

6. Flag-Waving: The article emphasizes Abrams' fight for democracy and representation, appealing to national feelings and a sense of justice.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article oversimplifies the cause of the election outcome by stating that "Kemp, while secretary of state, failed to maintain the security of voter information despite known vulnerabilities." This implies that Kemp's actions directly caused the issues with provisional ballots.

8. Loaded Language: "I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count." This statement carries strong emotional impact and emphasizes Abrams' commitment to ensuring every vote counts.

These propaganda techniques aim to create a narrative that favors Abrams and her campaign, while also emphasizing the importance of counting every provisional ballot.
