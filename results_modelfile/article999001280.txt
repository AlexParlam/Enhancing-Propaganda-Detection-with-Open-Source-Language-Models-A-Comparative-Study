The article is criticizing various media outlets, including CNN, for their perceived bias and dishonesty in reporting on a specific incident involving White House aide Kelly Sadler and CNN journalist Jim Acosta. The author argues that these outlets are lying about the events that transpired and are trying to manipulate public opinion.

Specifically, the article claims that CNN edited out a portion of the video showing Acosta's interaction with Sadler, which showed him touching her arm or hand. The author also criticizes other media outlets for repeating this narrative without fact-checking it.

The article also takes issue with self-proclaimed "fact-checkers" like Snopes and Politifact, claiming that they are not transparent about their own biases and are often wrong in their assessments.

Furthermore, the article questions the credibility of NewsGuard, a website that rates the transparency of other websites. The author claims that NewsGuard is not transparent about its own political bias and has rated CNN as having "straight news reporting" despite its history of fabricating stories.

The article concludes by arguing that this incident is just one example of the media's broader problem with dishonesty and propaganda, and that it should be used to remind people of the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking.
