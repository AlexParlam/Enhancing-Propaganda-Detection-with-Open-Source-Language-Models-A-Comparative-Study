Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "I felt terrible then" is an example of loaded language, as it evokes a strong emotional response from the audience.

2. Repetition: Clinton repeats his apology multiple times to emphasize its importance and sincerity.

3. Exaggeration/Minimization: Clinton downplays the significance of his private apology by saying that "the apology was public" and implying that this is what matters most.

4. Appeal to Authority: The article quotes Clinton as saying that he has apologized publicly on more than one occasion, which implies that his apology is genuine and effective because it was made in a public setting.

5. Flag-Waving: The article mentions the National Prayer Breakfast where Clinton made his public apology, which may evoke strong national feelings or a sense of moral obligation in the audience.

6. Thought-Terminating Clichés: Clinton's statement "I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned" is an example of thought-terminating clichés, as it discourages critical thinking and useful discussion about his actions.

7. Whataboutism/Straw Men/Red Herring: The article does not explicitly use this technique, but Clinton's statement "I dealt with it 20 years ago plus... I've tried to do a good job since then" could be seen as an attempt to deflect criticism by implying that he has moved on and done well in his life and work.

8. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options for Clinton's apology - public or private - without considering other possibilities, such as no apology at all.

9. Doubt: The article raises doubts about Lewinsky's credibility by mentioning her PTSD diagnosis and the impact of the #MeToo movement on her perspective, which may influence how readers perceive her account of the affair.
