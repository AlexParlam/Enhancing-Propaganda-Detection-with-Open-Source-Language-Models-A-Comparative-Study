A person who is "unclued" can survive, but it's unlikely they'll thrive or make informed decisions without guidance. In this context, the author, Paul Craig Roberts, is referring to President Trump and his administration.

Roberts argues that Trump has no idea how Washington works and has appointed people who don't support him, leading to a government working against him. He suggests that Trump could fight back by using the powers of the presidency to expose the conspiracy against him, which Roberts believes is a plot to overthrow democracy in America and establish the military/security complex's dominance.

Roberts' main points are:

1. The Russiagate investigation is a conspiracy against President Trump, not a legitimate inquiry into Russian interference.
2. The investigation is timed to influence the midterm elections and produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach Trump on false charges.
3. The presstitute media (mainstream news outlets) are complicit in this conspiracy by covering up the frameup and promoting unsubstantiated accusations against Trump.

Roberts concludes that if Trump is defeated and removed from office, it could lead to catastrophic consequences, including war with Russia and China, as these countries might realize they have no partner for conciliation with Washington.
