Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty" is used to describe California General Xavier Becerra, which carries a strong emotional impact and aims to evoke negative feelings towards him.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The description of Becerra as a "radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty" is an example of name calling, attempting to incite dislike or distrust from the audience.

3. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The statement "it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement" by Becerra is an attempt to build support by instilling anxiety towards the alternative (the publication of 3D gun blueprints).

4. Flag-Waving: The phrase "anti-liberty" is used to evoke strong national feelings and justify actions or ideas.

5. Causal Oversimplification: The statement that the Trump administration's action was "dangerous and incompetent" oversimplifies the issue, implying a single reason for the decision rather than considering multiple factors.

6. Appeal to Authority: The mention of a federal judge approving the settlement is an attempt to claim that the statement is true because a valid authority supports it.

7. Slogans: The phrase "radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty" can be seen as a slogan, using labeling and stereotyping to evoke strong emotions.

8. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The phrase "it's what it is" (not explicitly stated in the article but implied by the tone) discourages critical thought and useful discussion.

9. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The statement that Becerra is lying about the Trump administration giving the green light to distribute 3D gun blueprints is an attempt to discredit his position without directly disproving his argument.

10. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options as the only possibilities, ignoring other options (the publication of 3D gun blueprints being allowed or restricted).

11. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The statement that the Washington judge's stay will be overturned on appeal is an attempt to justify actions by stating that "everyone else" agrees.

12. Doubt: The article questions the credibility of Becerra and his statements, attempting to undermine trust in him.
