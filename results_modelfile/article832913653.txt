Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of phrases such as "total transparency" and "the full truth about Russia's interference in our democracy" aims to evoke a strong emotional response from the audience.

2. Repetition: The repetition of calls for the Mueller report to be released publicly, with multiple candidates making similar statements, is an attempt to reinforce the message and make it more convincing.

3. Appeal to Authority: Kamala Harris's statement calling on Attorney General Barr to testify under oath about the investigation and its findings appeals to the audience's respect for authority and the rule of law.

4. Flag-Waving: The article's use of phrases such as "the American people" and "our democracy" aims to evoke a sense of national pride and unity, which can be used to justify actions or ideas.

5. Slogans: The short, striking phrases used by the candidates, such as "Release the Mueller report!" and "Make it public!", are designed to be memorable and easy to repeat, much like a slogan.

6. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options - releasing the report publicly or not releasing it at all - without considering other possibilities, such as redacting certain information or providing a summary of the report instead.

7. Bandwagon: The fact that multiple candidates are calling for the report to be released publicly creates a sense of momentum and pressure on the administration to comply, which can be used to justify actions or ideas.
