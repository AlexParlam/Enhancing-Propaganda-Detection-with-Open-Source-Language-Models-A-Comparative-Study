Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The phrase "witch hunt" is used to describe the Mueller investigation, which carries a strong emotional impact and implies that the investigation is unfair and unjust.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: Trump's campaign is described as being accused of "alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia", which labels his campaign as having done something wrong without directly accusing them.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the phrase "no further indictments" multiple times to emphasize that there will be no new charges brought against anyone related to the Mueller investigation.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The article minimizes the significance of the Mueller report by stating that it is a "prosecutorial document presenting only one side", implying that it is not a comprehensive or balanced view of the situation.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article implies that if the full report is not released, it will be because the White House is trying to hide something, which appeals to the audience's fear and prejudice against the Trump administration.

6. Flag-Waving: The article mentions that the Mueller investigation was focused on "questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself", which uses strong national feelings (in this case, patriotism) to justify the investigation.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article implies that if there is no collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, it must be because there was no collusion, without considering other possible explanations or complexities.

8. Appeal to Authority: The article quotes Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz as saying that the report should not be judged until the full story is heard, which appeals to the audience's respect for authority figures.

9. Slogans: The phrase "Let people see it" is used by Trump and others to summarize their position on releasing the Mueller report, which is a brief and striking phrase that includes labeling and stereotyping.

10. Thought-Terminating Clich√©s: The phrase "It is what it is" is not explicitly stated in the article, but the idea that the report's findings are simply a fact that cannot be disputed is implied, which discourages critical thought and useful discussion.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: Representative Mark Meadows' tweet about there being no collusion because there were no indictments related to it is an example of whataboutism, as he is trying to discredit the investigation without directly disproving its findings.

12. Loaded Language: The phrase "sneak preview" is used to describe the White House's potential access to the Mueller report before it is released to the public, which carries a strong emotional impact and implies that the administration is trying to hide something.

Note that some of these techniques may be implicit or subtle, but they are all present in the article.
