Here are the propaganda techniques detected in the article:

1. Loaded Language: The use of words like "Yikes!" and "darkness" creates a strong emotional impact on the reader.

2. Name Calling / Labeling: The description of the CIA's interrogation program as "state sponsored torture programs" is an attempt to incite negative emotions towards it.

3. Repetition: The article repeats the phrase "torture occurred" and "torture carried out" multiple times to emphasize the point.

4. Exaggeration / Minimization: The statement that the CIA's interrogation program was one of the "darkest chapters in American history" is an exaggeration, as it implies that the entire country was affected by this issue.

5. Appeal to Fear / Prejudice: The article appeals to fear by stating that the consequences of the CIA's actions are still being dealt with today and that Americans should be concerned about the future.

6. Flag-Waving: The mention of "universal human rights" and the idea that the country was founded on this principle is an attempt to appeal to national pride and justify a particular stance.

7. Causal Oversimplification: The article implies that the CIA's actions were solely responsible for the consequences, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the situation.

8. Appeal to Authority: The quote from John McCain is presented as an authority on the issue, implying that his opinion should be respected and considered.

9. Slogans: The phrase "Americans who value the Constitution" is a slogan that attempts to rally people behind a particular cause.

10. Thought-Terminating Clichés: The statement "it's what it is" (not present in this article) is an example of thought-terminating clichés, but the article does use phrases like "we are still dealing with the consequences" which can be seen as discouraging critical thought.

11. Whataboutism / Straw Men / Red Herring: The article presents Mike Pompeo's commitment to upholding the law as a standard for Gina Haspel, without directly disproving her argument or addressing potential counterarguments.

12. Black-and-White Fallacy: The article presents two alternative options - that Gina Haspel will uphold the prohibition on enhanced interrogation techniques or that she will not - without considering other possibilities.

13. Bandwagon / Reductio ad Hitlerum: The statement "Americans who value the Constitution should take this rare moment to agree with McCain" is an attempt to get people to join a particular side, implying that disagreeing would be wrong.

14. Doubt: The article questions Gina Haspel's credibility by stating that she needs to explain her involvement in the CIA's interrogation program during the confirmation process.

Note: Some of these techniques may be used subtly or indirectly, and some may be more obvious than others.
